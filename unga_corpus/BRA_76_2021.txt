Mister President of the General Assembly, Abidulla Charrid,
- Mister Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres,
- Heads of States and Government and other Heads of Delegation,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
- It is an honor to one more time open the General Assembly of the United
Nations.
- I come here to show a Brazil that is different from the one portrayed on the
newspapers or seen on television. Brazil has changed – a lot – since we have
taken office in January of 2019.
- There has been not a single case of corruption in the past 2 years and 8
months.
- Brazil has a President who believes in God, respects its military, values
family and is loyal to its people.
- It is a lot; it is a solid basis, if we consider that we were at the brink of
socialism.
- Our state-owned enterprises which once incurred in billions of dollars in
losses are now lucrative.
- Our National Development Bank was used to finance projects in
communist countries, without any guarantees. It is the Brazilian people itself
who honors these commitments.
- All of that has changed. I present to you now a new Brazil, a country that
recovered its credibility.
- Brazil has the largest public-private partnership program of its history. A
program that is a reality, and it is being fully implemented.
- So far, 100 billion US dollars in new investments were contracted and 23
billion were collected in concessions.
- In the infrastructure sector, we have auctioned 34 airports and 29 port
terminals to the private sector.
- We have already more than 6 billion US dollars in private contracts for new
railroads. We have introduced a railway permit system, which brings our
model closer to the American model. In just a few days, we received 14
applications for permits for new railroads, which accounts for almost 15
billion US dollars in private investment.
- In our government, we have promoted the revitalization of the railway
system.
- As a result, there has been less fossil fuel consumption and the decrease of
the operational costs associated with doing business in Brazil, especially in
relation to food production.
- Great progress has been made in the area of sanitation. The largest auction
in this sector’s history took place in April, with the concession to the private
sector of water distribution and sewage services in Rio de Janeiro.
- We have everything that investors are looking for: a large consumer market,
excellent assets, a tradition of respecting contracts, and confidence in our
government.
- I also announce that in the next few days, we will hold the auction for the
implementation of 5G technology in Brazil.
- Our modern and sustainable low-carbon agriculture feeds more than 1
billion people around the world and takes up only 8% of the national
territory.
- No other country in the world has such a comprehensive environmental
legislation. Our Forest Code sets an example for other countries.
- Brazil is a country of continental proportions, with great environmental
challenges. It has 8.5 million square kilometers, of which 66% are still
covered with the same native vegetation of the country’s discovery.
- In the Amazon biome alone, 84% of the forest is intact, harboring the
greatest biodiversity on the planet. I would remind you that the Amazon
region has an area equivalent to that of all Western Europe.
- We anticipated, from 2060 to 2050, the objective of reaching climate
neutrality. Human and financial resources aimed at strengthening the
environmental agencies were doubled, with a view to eliminate illegal
deforestation.
- And this important action is already beginning to bear fruits!
- In the Amazon, deforestation was reduced by 32% in August in comparison
with August of the previous year.
- Which country in the world has an environmental preservation policy such
as ours?
- You are all invited to visit our Amazon!
- Brazil is already an example in energy generation, with 83% coming
from renewable sources.
- At COP-26 we will seek consensus on the rules of the global carbon
credit market. We expect industrialized countries to effectively meet their
climate financing commitments in significant amounts.
- The future of green jobs is in Brazil: renewable energy, sustainable
agriculture, low emission industry, sanitation, waste treatment and tourism.
- We have ratified the Inter-American Convention Against Racism, Racial
Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance.
- For us, the traditional family is the foundation of civilization. And the
freedom of the human being is only fulfilled by the freedom to worship.
- 14% of our national territory, namely, over 110 million hectares, an area
equivalent to Germany and France combined, is destined to indigenous
people reservations. In those regions, 600 thousand indigenous peoples live
in freedom and share a growing wish to make use of their lands to agriculture
and other activities.
- Brazil has always participated in UN Peacekeeping Operations. From Suez
to Congo, from Haiti to Lebanon.
- Our country has always welcomed refugees. In our border with neighboring
Venezuela, the “Operation Welcome”, by the Federal Government, has
already received 400 thousand Venezuelans displaced by the severe
economic and political crisis brought forth by the Bolivarian dictatorship.
- The future of Afghanistan also gives us cause for deep apprehension. We
will grant humanitarian visas to Afghan Christians, women, children and
judges.
- In this 20th year since the terrorist attacks against the United States of
America on September 11th 2001, I reiterate our condemnation of terrorism
in all its forms.
- In 2022, we will once again hold a seat at the United Nations Security
Council. I thank all the 181 countries, out of 190, who trusted Brazil. A
reflection of the serious, responsible foreign policy promoted by our
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- We support a reform of the UN Security Council, in which we seek a
permanent seat.
- The pandemic caught all by surprise in 2020. We regret every death in
Brazil and in the world.
- I have always supported the fight against the virus and unemployment, in a
simultaneous manner and with equal responsibility. Isolation measures and
lockdowns have left a legacy of inflation, particularly of food prices, all over
the world.
- In Brazil, in order to help those in need, forced to stay home by decisions
from governors and mayors and who lost their source of income, we granted
an emergency relief compensation of US$ 800 each for 68 million people in
2020.
- I recall that we finished 2020, the year of the pandemic, with more formal
jobs than those accounted for in December 2019 due to the actions of our
government and programmes aimed at job and income support, which costed
us around US$ 40 billion.
- During the first seven months of this year, approximately 1 million 800
thousand new jobs were created. Our expected growth for 2021 is of 5%.
- Up to the present, the Federal Government has distributed more than 260
million doses of the vaccine and more than 140 million Brazilians,
representing almost 90% of our adult population, have received at least the
first dose. 80% of the indigenous population have also been fully vaccinated.
By November, all those who wish to do so will be vaccinated in Brazil.
- We support vaccination, however, our government is against a sanitary
passport or any vaccine related obligation.
- Since the start of the pandemic we have supported doctor’s autonomy in
search of an early treatment, as recommended by our Federal Council of
Medicine. I was among those who tried the early treatment. We also respect
the doctor-patient relationship with regard to the medication to be used and
its off-label utilization.
- We don’t understand why many countries, along with a large portion of the
media, oppose early treatment.
- History and Science will hold them accountable.
- On the last 7th of September, our Independence Day, millions of Brazilians,
in a peaceful and patriotic manner, took to the streets, in the largest
demonstration in our history, to proclaim that they will not forgo democracy
and individual liberties and to show support for our government.
- As demonstrated, Brazil is living in new times. In economic terms, we have
one of the best performances among emerging countries.
- My government has restored Brazil´s external credibility and, today, it is
one of the most promising destinations for investments.
- It is here, at this General Assembly, that we envisage a world with greater
freedom, democracy, prosperity and peace.
God bless us all.
