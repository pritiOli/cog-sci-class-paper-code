On the occasion of the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, 22 September 2021
Your Excellency Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly,
Your Excellency António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations,
Excellencies,
Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. President,
• I congratulate you, on your election, to preside over this 76th session, of the General Assembly.
• I assure you, of my country’s full support, during your presidency
• I take this opportunity, to acknowledge His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, for his sterling leadership, of the very challenging previous session, and wish him well in his future endeavors.
• The unpredictable turns, of the global political and economic landscape, demonstrate, that multilateral cooperation, international solidarity, and concrete action, are required more than ever.
Indeed, Mr. President,
• We all should work together, to deliver for the People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnerships.
• All of these inter-connected challenges can be considered a puzzle, whereby the pieces can be found, in various countries.
• I urge all of us, to work together, to solve this puzzle and secure the future of our planet.
• With this, we will demonstrate leadership, humanity and political responsibility and commitment.
• Now distinguished colleagues, is the time for solidarity, unity and global leadership!
Mr. President,
• The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly highlighted, that when in crisis, seemingly international solidarity, has little, or no meaning.
• Multilateralism and international solidarity came under pressure.
• It has unveiled weaknesses of the effectiveness of our international mechanisms, and global legal infrastructure.
• Regretfully the principle of collective effort and responsibility, was replaced by a more individual approach.
• One to protect the nation first.
• However, I am taking this opportunity, to express my sincere gratitude, to the countries and organizations, who expressed solidarity, and had provided valuable support, to my country and people, in the battle against this pandemic, at a very early stage, our thanks extend especially to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, India, China and also the USA.
• Mr. President, the exposed weaknesses of our health systems, must be addressed, with innovative measures, with the use of modern technology and international cooperation.
• Allow me, as we go forward, to underscore the importance of using science and technology, for peaceful purposes.
We also need to pay attention, to the long-term social, and psychological aspects, the widening of the education gap, and the digital divide, as well as the unequal access to vaccines.
• Moreover, many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as a middle-income region, regrettably, have not benefitted from the various COVID-19 multilateral debt relief solutions.
• Mr. President, we must develop a post COVID-strategy, with a focus on:
o Developing an effective strategy to improve vaccination levels in our societies.
o Rebuilding the economy;
o And establishing a COVID 19 recovery fund, with support of the international financial institutions and the private sector;
• We cannot go back, to what we were used to, but rather focus on:
o How we organize ourselves, for the “new normal”, with COVID-19 as part of our lives;
o Removing barriers, for ease of doing business and investments.
Mr. President,
• Beyond the severe impact of COVID-19, we have been challenged, with financial and economic deficiencies, including a high debt burden.
• In this regard, access to concessional financing, is of critical importance, in rebooting our economy.
• Currently, we face unrealistic, unfair, and counterproductive classification instruments.
• Suriname looks forward to new substantive methods of financial support, based on the socio-economic reality, of the countries concerned.
• At the same time, the vulnerabilities of countries, should be taken into account.
• I call on all, to support the multi-dimensional vulnerability index, as proposed by SIDS (Small Island Developing States) and remove bureaucracy in supporting these states.
• It is, in the interest of all of us!
Mr. President,
• Suriname supports the call for a stronger and more effective United Nations.
• A restructured and revitalized United Nations must ensure, that the organization, remains the source of redress, for the international community, and home, to international justice and equitable decision-making.
• It is my firm believe, societies should be organized based on democratic values, good governance, an independent judiciary, and with respect for human rights.
• In achieving these objectives, we must allow countries, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, to develop sustainable economies, without obstacles.
• Isolation and trade blockades, such as, in the case of Cuba, in my own region, undermine these principles and are counterproductive, to achieving these goals.
• Therefore, I am calling for continued dialogue and negotiations, to solve differences and conflicts, within the framework of the charter of the United Nations.
Mr. President,
• Climate change remains a serious challenge and an existential threat, which requires the attention of all us.
• In recent months, we have witnessed its worldwide impact, such as deadly floods, widespread forest fires and significant rises in global temperature.
• No country or region was spared of its wrath!
• In the case of my country, Suriname, and the countries, with low-lying coastal areas, we are committed, to fighting climate change, because we are particularly vulnerable, even though, we have contributed, the least, to this problem.
• Suriname is a High Forest, Low Deforestation country, with a forest coverage of approx. 93%.
• Suriname significantly contributes, to the mitigation of the effects of climate change.
• We are one, of the few carbons negative rating countries, in the world.
• Yet, we are not fully benefitting, from global arrangements, associated with sound forest management.
• The time has come, to acknowledge the unique challenges, faced by the high forest, low deforestation developing countries, and to improve and maximize, their fair access to climate finance.
• As we prepare for COP 26, in early November this year, in Glasgow, we must bear in mind, that noble ideals, with strong political commitments, do not mean much, if not supported, with new financial resources.
• COP 26, therefore, should result in ambitious and actionable commitments.
• Suriname calls on developed countries, to recommit to the 100 billion US dollars per year, to support developing countries, as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
• In this regard, I stress the importance of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) and the need, to support its activities, aimed at protecting the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity.
Mr. President,
• One year ago, the new government of Suriname, under my leadership, took office, and had to deal with several financial and economic challenges.
• Amidst the climate change challenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic, my country is also confronted with a challenging fiscal choice, between servicing, an increased sovereign debt, or to spend more in health, education, and the livelihoods of our citizens.
• In order, to get the tremendous foreign debt under control and make our economy healthy again, my country had decided, to develop a comprehensive recovery plan, which at staff level, has been approved by the IMF, and we look forward to Board Level approval as soon as possible.
• Suriname, is also at the cusp, of attracting substantial foreign direct investments, particularly in the extractive industry, agriculture and tourism.
• For this purpose, the enabling environment, is being prepared, including the development of a local content policy and a new investment code, to facilitate these investments.
• Therefore, I am inviting the international business community, to invest in my beautiful country and contribute, to sustainable development and the earmarked transition towards a green economy.
In closing Mr. President,
• I stand here, at the stronghold of multilateralism and international solidarity, and call on all of us, to play our part in moving our words into action.
• We need a new more agile, equitable and effective multilateralism, based on the new realities, the world is facing today.
• One that is efficient, with collective leadership, a solution-oriented approach, and serving the needs of all countries.
Mr. President,
Distinguished leaders,
• It is our obligation, as leaders of today, to build a better world and planet, for those living today, but more so, for those generations still to come.
I thank you. May God bless you.
