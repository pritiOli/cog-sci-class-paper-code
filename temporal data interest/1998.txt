I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his
assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at
its current session. I believe that his wisdom and
experience will enable him to accomplish his important
mission with distinction.
I would also like to express my appreciation for the
contribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the
General Assembly during the previous session.
At present, the international situation is undergoing
profound changes. The accelerated trend towards
multipolarity has injected new vitality into international
relations. Economic globalization is developing very
quickly, and countries are becoming increasingly
interdependent. The development of multipolarity and
globalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment
of international relations.

Bilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-
confrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against
third countries, have been established one after another.
Various regional and intercontinental organizations of
cooperation have become more active than ever before.
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,
pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute
to peace and development as well as to the establishment
of a fair and equitable new international political and
economic order.

However, we cannot lose sight of the many
uncertainties still existing in the world.
The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In
the post-cold-war period of today, the people of all
countries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.
It is to be regretted that last May India conducted
nuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus
adversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.
Soon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear
tests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the
tension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy
blow to international nuclear disarmament and the
mechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This
has aroused the great concern of the international
community. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully
implement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, as well as the provisions
of Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their
plans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and
unconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and
Pakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir
through peaceful means.
In our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,
the international community faces the pressing task of
consolidating and strengthening the international non-
proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of
nuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority
of the NPT.
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,
the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly
that a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons
should be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the
Chinese Government has on many occasions called on all
the other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and
nuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a
convention on no first use of nuclear weapons through
negotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a
fissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the
negotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign
the Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the
Chinese Government that China will abide by the
provisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming
nuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies
of unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and
unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will
continue to support the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory
and verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis
of the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the
largest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear
disarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its
responsibility.
The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July
1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of
many countries of the region. Its negative impact is still
spreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen
since last June has added to the difficulty of economic
recovery in the region.
The crisis occurred in the overall context of
economic globalization, and its impact is being felt across
the world. Stepping up international cooperation and
putting an early end to this crisis is not only in the
immediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also
in the interests of the international community as a whole,
and especially of the developed countries. We hope that
those developed countries with important influence on the
region’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and
take active, resolute and effective measures to make their
due contributions to safeguarding the stability of the
financial order and promoting the recovery and
development of the region’s economy.
Following the eruption of the East Asian financial
crisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly
responsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the
countries concerned within the framework arranged by
International Monetary Fund and, at the same time,
through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall
interests of maintaining the stability and development of
the region, China has made the decision not to devalue
the yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great
pressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the
growing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to
maintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain
unchanged.
Fighting with one heart and one mind, we won the
battle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a
series of measures to deepen our reform and expand
11


domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of
our economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise
in this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believe
that with the common efforts of the countries in the region
and of the rest of the international community, the East
Asian economy will be able to gradually get out of its
predicament and return to the road of sound development.
The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate
for some time, which has aroused widespread concern in
the international community. We are of the view that the
Arab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic
negotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental
interests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive
to world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties
concerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible
and pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the
peace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and
on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and
the agreements already reached. The Chinese Government
will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and
the efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant
parties to this end.
We are following the developments in the Kosovo
region of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the
parties involved will solve the problem through political
dialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the
Balkans have been hard won and should be cherished all
the more by the relevant parties and by the international
community.
The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are
another source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will
be appropriately resolved by the parties involved through
peaceful means.
The twenty-first century is greeting us. On the
threshold of the new century, the United Nations bears
heavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world
peace, promoting human progress and establishing a just
and rational new international political and economic order.
It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end
of the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints
and more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented
opportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and
can use its own advantages to play a unique and
constructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable
world, in establishing a new type of international
relationship based on friendship and cooperation and in
taking up the common challenges facing mankind.
China has consistently held that it is necessary to
carry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that
the Organization can better keep abreast of the changing
situation and serve its numerous Member States. We have
taken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform
in a number of fields promoted by all Member States.
Some reform measures and recommendations proposed by
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been
approved by the General Assembly and are now being put
into practice. Intense discussions on reform of the
Security Council are also in orderly progress. At present,
there are still differences among Member States on quite
a few issues involved in the reform of the Security
Council. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive
approach and play an active part in the relevant
consultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement
of relevant issues.
Here, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the
Chinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of
the Security Council bears on the interests of all countries
and so requires a democratic style of work and extensive
and full consultations. All Member States should have an
equal right to speak on the question of the reform, and
their reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.
Secondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich
countries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet
the concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more
attention should be given to the interests and aspirations
of the vast number of developing countries.
Representation should be balanced between the developed
and the developing countries.
Thirdly, the reform measures are of major
significance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the
Security Council in maintaining international peace and
security. They should be worked out on the basis of the
realities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course
that the objective of the reform of the Security Council is
to solve problems rather than to create new sources of
discord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security
Council gains extensive support from Member States, it
is essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously
promoted the advancement and development of the cause
12


of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in
Asia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from
colonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark
system of apartheid, won basic political rights and became
an equal member of the international community. The
United Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international
instruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the
Right to Development, further enriching the content of
human rights. The right to development has been
universally recognized in the international community as an
inseparable part of basic human rights.
In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken
place in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the
introduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed
an ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved
legal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the
rights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese
people now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality
than ever before and a much fuller and more settled life
than in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to
make unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to
strengthen the legal system, while developing the economy
so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to
the full.
The Chinese Government is active in supporting and
participating in the activities of the United Nations in the
field of human rights. China has all along stood for
international cooperation in the field of human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance
understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground
and strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese
Government is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and
cooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,
with human rights organizations at the national and
international levels.
Last October, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese
Government has decided to sign it early next month. This
once again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese
Government with respect to promoting and protecting
human rights. China is ready to continue to work with other
countries to maintain and increase the current positive
momentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote
the furtherance of the world cause of human rights.
This year is the twentieth anniversary of the
introduction of the policy of reform and opening up in
China. In these two decades, China has scored
tremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and
modernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our
national economy has gained a favourable momentum of
high growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened
reforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last
September, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth
National Congress, formulated a blueprint for China’s
cross-century development based on the new
developments both on the domestic and international
scene. In March this year, our new State institutions and
new Government were formed through elections at the
first session of the ninth National People’s Congress of
China. We will build energetically on our political and
economic restructuring and carry forward the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
twenty-first century in a comprehensive way.
China’s modernization drive requires a stable
international environment of peace. China will continue to
pursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This
policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in
independence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard
world peace, and to seek common development.
To persist in independence and maintain the
initiative, we always put our State sovereignty and
national security first and never develop relations with
other countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred
territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the
upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide
useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,
adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and
one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang
Zemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait
relations and promoting the process of peaceful
reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and
resolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of
Taiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and
Taiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.
We respect the sovereignty of other countries and
vigorously support the efforts of all countries in the
world, and of developing countries in particular, to defend
their State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our
own. In handling international relations, we adhere to
non-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of
Third States. We do not go in for military blocs and the
13


arms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China’s
development will not pose a threat to any other country.
The so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded and
fabricated with ulterior motives.
To safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for
the maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is
our consistent view that State-to-State relations should be
handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful
coexistence, transcending differences in social systems and
ideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests
and, at the same time, respect those of others and
continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by
seeking the convergent points of common interests. With
regard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary
to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and
strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by
resorting to force or the threat of force.
It is essential to completely reject the mentality of the
cold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve
international and regional security issues through consensus
and participation on an equal footing. We in China stand
for the equality of all countries, big or small, and for
accelerated democratization of international relations. World
affairs should be handled through consultation by all
countries, and no country should impose its own will on
others.
To seek common development, peace is the
prerequisite of development and development is the basis of
peace. In today’s world, where the economy is increasingly
globalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order
to achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside
world is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As a
huge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of
the trend of economic globalization and be even more
active in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop
trade and expand scientific and technological exchanges
with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches
importance to and actively participates in the activities of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)
and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the
establishment and development of friendly exchanges and
cooperation with other global and intercontinental or
regional organizations for economic cooperation.
China continues to take a positive attitude towards
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to
unremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified
for entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations
have dragged on and on with no decision having been
made. China is a developing country, and we can
negotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis,
in accordance with the principle of balancing rights and
obligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned
will take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up
excessive demands and work for an early conclusion of
the relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO will
benefit all its members and make the multilateral trade
mechanism complete and more balanced.
Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to
use the forum of the United Nations to brief you on
China’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing
to such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,
catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,
Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the
submerged regions, the duration of the floods and the
seriousness of the disaster they caused were something
rarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of
people’s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government
mobilized forces from all sectors across the country and
organized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out
battle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the
assaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the
safety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and
major cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of
life and property was kept to a minimum.
At present, the Chinese Government is sparing no
effort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has
started reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We
are taking every measure possible, with full confidence,
to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread
epidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and
that none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas
will drop out from school or be deprived of education. In
the course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the
great flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to
push forward our reform and opening up and the socialist
modernization drive.
Since China was hit by the disastrous floods, a
number of countries and international organizations and
communities have sent messages to express sympathy and
solicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.
I wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people, our most sincere
gratitude to them.
The world of today is a world of interdependence.
The promotion of peace, cooperation and development has
14


become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and
work together to bring into the twenty-first century a world
of peace, security and stability in the interest of
development.











I congratulate
you, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good
fortune and all of us a successful session.
I should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for
the dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-
second session. He advanced the reform process at the
United Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must
follow up these efforts.
This session of the General Assembly has a special
significance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to
the day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became
the first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of
Germany to address the United Nations. When he described
our perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant
more than the mere security of States, more than the mere
regulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what
it is all about is the beginning and the objective of any
rational policy â€” people.
That description of our role in the United Nations
remains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a
world free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law,
a world in which every individual has his opportunity and
which preserves the integrity of Creation for future
generations. It is the vision enshrined in the International
Bill of Human Rights.
We have come a lot closer to that vision over the past
25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world
has been healed. The world is developing ever more into
the â€œone worldâ€ on the foundations of democracy and
human rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that
the human race has never been so bound up together in its
common destiny, united by common challenges, as it is
today.
The crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world
economy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime
and terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The
year 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of
Bangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in
China have claimed thousands of lives.
No State, whether super-Power or small island State,
can master these global challenges alone. And no one can
escape them, least of all the suffering people: the
homeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the
victim of civil war in Africa.
We can shape our future only through joint efforts.
We therefore need global action and global management
for the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not
tomorrow or the day after, but today.
This is a test not only for Governments but also for
the other global players: the non-governmental
organizations and the multinational corporations. Never
were the non-governmental organizations so important as
they are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention
banning landmines could not have been signed in
December 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the worldâs
hundred largest economic entities are now companies, and
only 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has
come for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity
throughout the world.
The age of globalization is the age of the United
Nations. Only here do all nations of the world come
together. Only here can we find joint solutions to the
global challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we
Germans want to help get the United Nations in shape for
the twenty-first century. We are facing up to this
responsibility â€” as the second largest export nation and
the third largest economy in the world, and as the country
with the largest population in the European Union.
We owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude
and support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the
Member States. The Security Council still mirrors the
world as it was at the end of the Second World War, but
not the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the Caribbean.
The same is true of the greater weight of Japan and
united Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that
advocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security
Council. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any
longer; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that
would be bad indeed.
16


Since the ending of the cold war the United Nations
has had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore
needs effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right
to expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and
especially the big members, must help according to their
ability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish
its tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will
continue to meet its obligations.
We know from recent experience that we should not
add to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.
This is a task especially for regional organizations like the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If
they succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security
Council will not need to deal with them. I think that would
be very well-advised, because it would free capacities for
all of us.
New avenues of joint action are therefore called for.
To pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.
Only those who face up to the challenge can exploit the
opportunities and cushion the risks.
The impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that
the world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not
to say we need a global financial authority or fixed
exchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism.
But we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more
transparency and more efficient banking systems, especially
in the newly emerging economies.
This is not a task for Governments alone. What is
needed now is a global public-private partnership between
Governments, international financial organizations and
corporations. We therefore support the American initiative
for a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging
economies on a new international financial architecture. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
should not always have to serve as the stopgap when the
opportunity for structural reforms has been missed.
Managing globalization also means weaving a network
of partnerships between the big regional groupings and the
big countries. The regional groupings are the components
of a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.
The European Unionâs partnerships with regional
organizations like the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market
(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We
want an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism.
I am confident that the European Union will be an
anchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By
introducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is
focusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is
about to begin further negotiations on accession with
associated partners. What Willy Brandt said about
Germany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:
â€œWhat belongs together is now growing togetherâ€.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too
is also gradually opening its doors to the new
democracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will
admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together
with Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of
Independent States members, we are developing a
comprehensive security partnership.
True, the Russians are having a rough time at
present, but the world needs a democratic and stable
Russia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate
with its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a
Herculean task of consolidating the economy and
maintaining social stability. All those responsible must
face up to the challenge: the President, the Government,
the parties and business. Of course, the regions too are
called upon.
I know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov
last week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to
change course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia
affects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count
on us.
The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâs
side. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the
word is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than
250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations,
the European Union, the United States and Russia are
coordinating their efforts to enable those who have been
driven out to return to their villages.
Time is getting short; winter is just around the
corner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that
the international community will react with military force
if necessary. We still seek a political solution for
Kosovo â€” self-administration within the Yugoslav
Federation. However, this cannot be achieved without
Belgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be
silenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav
security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The
recent reports we have received from Kosovo are very
17


disappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not
true.
NATO is prepared to provide the backing for a
political solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of
Europe. Their future can only be a European one. The
history of Europe in this century shows that we can
overcome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the
willingness to do so.
In Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being
replaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my
twelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly
beginning to blossom again, and the countryâs
reconstruction is progressing.
Nonetheless, the peace process must continue to be
buttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR),
for the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the
result of the elections, the international community will not
tolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace
agreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until
the presumed war criminals and enemies of peace â€”
Mr. Karadzic and his lot â€” have been brought to trial in
The Hague.
Only when those guilty of crimes against humanity,
torturers and terrorists all over the world, have been
brought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.
Thus, the establishment of the International Criminal
Court on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in
which the force of law, not the law of force, prevails.
Germany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to
sign and ratify the Courtâs Statute.
No one stands more at the mercy of those who wield
power than refugees. At present more than 20 million
people worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people,
women, children; people who are sick, homeless and
destitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to
happen to them.
Over the last several years I have been to many
refugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East.
Every refugeeâs case is a story of immeasurable human
suffering.
Germany is now the country with the second largest
number of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees
have found refuge in Germany.
The suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and
political challenge to the international community as a
whole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee
policy. The United Nations, too, has to do something
about it.
Specifically, this means, first, a more equitable
distribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the
General Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest
countries to their own devices in trying to cope with the
refugee problem.
Secondly, greater efforts will have to be made to
remove the causes of flight and expulsion.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the
twenty-first century a century of prevention, and with
good reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that
people have to take flight is to make oneself partly
responsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.
This is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights
observers and peacekeeping forces.
Striking at the root of mass flight and migration also
means eliminating the economic, ecological and social
causes. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The
wealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume
86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3
per cent.
This equity gap must be closed. Every individual has
a right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want.
All nations must be given a fair chance in global
competition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up
to the rich countries to help the poor make the most of
their opportunities for development.
Our aim is a social world market economy. This is
why in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks
on bilateral and multilateral assistance measures â€” an
investment in peace and stability.
Africa shows what can be achieved when the
international community and the countries concerned pull
together. Today, democratic elections are held in more
than half of the African countries. In 20 African countries
economic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11
it is higher still.
We want the Africans to know that we will not
abandon that vast continent and its 800 million people,
despite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.
18


Poverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating
the situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in
the Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything
else on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.
The Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each
other again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.
We Europeans will continue to support this process
with our American friends. We back Israelâs legitimate
claim to security for its State and citizens.
The Palestinians have recognized that claim; now
words must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that
terrorism has no chance.
But Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a
further partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new
obstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowing
new settlements in the occupied territories.
Particularly in the Middle East, we have time and
again seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction
and suffering. We must pit all our strength against the
cynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues;
the dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a
warning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must
be brought to justice.
Drying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty, ethnic
conflict and fundamentalism â€” is our common
responsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.
Islam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be
further from the truth than the clichÃ© that Islam is
synonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human
rights.
We want a dialogue of cultures and religions,
especially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity
that unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable
dignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights
covenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks
for our joint action in the twenty-first century.
Violations of human rights are no longer an internal
matter of States. They concern us all. Any group which,
like the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human
rights places itself outside the international community of
common values.
The world of tomorrow will be judged by how we
treat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.
Yet the rights of many children are still being trampled
underfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a
life in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.
Particularly appalling is the fact that every year
some two million children all over the world are sexually
abused. Only through joint action can we stop child
prostitution, traffic in children and child pornography,
including that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore
propose that the United Nations set up a contact point to
coordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of
children. The optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child designed to afford better protection
against sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and
quickly put into effect.
Children are small people who need big rights.
Protection for children during armed conflicts must be
improved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers.
We all hoped that with the ending of the East-West
confrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would
be gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The
threat of proliferation of means of mass destruction
hovers over the human race. We can safeguard world
peace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such
terrible weapons under control.
In Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to
negotiations on a cut-off. Thatâs a good sign, but not
nearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all
nations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. This also applies to the conventions banning
chemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a
verification protocol to the Biological Weapons
Convention is now urgent.
Next March the Ottawa Convention imposing a
worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into
force â€” a great success. Only if all countries now sign
the Convention will these diabolical devices soon be
wiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task
to get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using
state-of-the-art technology.
We must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.
The victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a
warning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we
owe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our
blue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.
19


Take the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched
a global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.
But time is getting short. We have just had the warmest
half year this century. At the fourth session of the
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires
in November, we shall have to agree on the instruments
with which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.
Take water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more
important than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in
short supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or
none at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions
for the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source
of life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.
The pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed
to spark fresh conflicts.
Germany intends to remain in the vanguard of the
international campaign to protect the environment. I am
gratified to note that our commitment has been
acknowledged by the appointment of Klaus TÃ¶pfer as
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment
Programme.
But we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few
days ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam
on early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The
conference has shown that progress can be achieved if we
want it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing
effective global early-warning systems for environmental
crises and natural disasters, and developing emergency
management arrangements for the coordination of
international relief measures. We must now get down to
this task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so.
Four hundred and sixty three days from now the
twentieth century comes to an end â€” a century of
unprecedented violence and destruction. The coming
century must be a century with a humane countenance.
What a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not
enough. Only if we act together will we survive together.
The United Nations is indispensable to this task.
Strengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable
world â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming
generations. My country will devote every possible effort
to this task.








Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,
on your election, which attests to the high regard in which
the international community holds you and your country,
and which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,
welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session
of the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead
to the strengthening of the Organization.
It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the
peoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person...to
establish conditions under which justice...can be
maintained, and to promote social progress”.
That immense ambition was justified by the recent
horrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from
happening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a
superhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert
Camus put it:
”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time
to accomplish, that’s all.”
A long time has elapsed, and we are still working on
that, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what
we have done as the United Nations throughout these 53
years, of what the Security Council and successive General
Assemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-
General — in particular the current one over the last two
years, whose work has been so outstanding.
Over the decades, the Security Council, except when
paralysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed
to shoulder its primary responsibility for international
security. When it failed to do so, no other institution was
able to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50
years ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations
of this kind.
The institutional framework established by the
Charter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from
cold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,
proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne
out in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when
the Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in
Africa, during the creation of the United Nations Mission
in the Central African Republic, which was the first
entirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and
even in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted
to the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its
objective.
And yet, as the Secretary-General himself
emphasized recently,
“Unpredictability and surprise have become almost
commonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1),
and the illusions of the end of the cold war have not
stood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge
this fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.
Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some
States take advantage of circumstances and deliberately
carry out archaic policies of force that contravene the
principles of the Charter. On other occasions, the
abdication or implosion of States has released among
various groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very
much alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these
are destabilizing factors which, while very different, all
help to disorganize and imperil international relations.
Several major crises have proved this recently. The
Asian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,
when badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world
that is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive
reactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid
spread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is
exchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of
money that are greater than the means of intervention of
all the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those
amounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.
Today, they are 15 times greater.
The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic
reminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute
combined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity
could open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.
In East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of
a border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven
States are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory
15


of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization
is threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I
cannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,
civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve
more than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.
Twenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and
returnees — have been affected by these conflicts and
require assistance from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active
in 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;
slavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;
disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.
But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of
woe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which
is the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very
moment trying to maintain peace on four continents with
approximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17
operations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20
agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.
Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in
1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.
I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the
multilateral system do not today have the necessary means
to meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not
give up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our
action?
Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,
we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our
institutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security
Council a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the
case of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and
acts of aggression”.
Nothing can justify the use of force by a State, a
group of States or an organization, however powerful, if
prior authorization was not received from the Security
Council — except in cases of self-defence.
My country shares the impatience of those who
deplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution
to various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where
the humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November
1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put
forward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its
other partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground
for a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for
the return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible
use of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to
forgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after
this case there would be another exception, and then
another. Little by little, any country would declare itself
entitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or
ambitions so required, and we would have to begin all
over again. We must remain firm on this principle.
Second, we must make sure that the authority of the
Security Council is respected and its resolutions are
complied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today
the question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.
The lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s
resolutions, been made subject to the controlled
dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must
therefore meet these conditions — completely meet them,
but only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim
must be to reintegrate Iraq into the international
community, starting with the region.
The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s
complete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all
the resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which
means Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United
Nations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s
disarmament.
The third need is to increase the representativeness
of the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.
This is why my country has come out in favour of
enlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,
new permanent members — two seats for the North, to
which Germany and Japan have every claim, and three
for the South; on the other hand, there should be new
non-permanent members for the North and South. This
enlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s
effectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its
responsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third
session of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.
Fourth, we must increase the capacity of our
Organization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is
much to be done. Now that the international community
has just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the
peace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in
Madrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,
and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France
continues to support the persevering efforts of the United
States Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left
without any prospects at all should those efforts
unfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac
and President Mubarak have proposed in that event
convening a conference of countries resolved to save the
16


peace. This concern for the future has been very well
received. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working
to further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of
meeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a
just and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and
agreements that have been reached.
Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As I
mentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo six or seven African States of the
Great Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle
of problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,
ethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so
forth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each
of these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a
regional solution. That is why my country has raised again
the idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes
region, which we suggested as early as 1995. The
conference would be placed under the aegis of the United
Nations or the Organization of African Unity, with the
active participation of the States of the region. Several
African diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We
support those efforts.
Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us
pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s
representatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of
Matre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.
Fifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral
disarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the
nuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone
recognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime
and pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear,
conventional, chemical and biological.
Our primary objective here should be the entry into
force as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United
Kingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the
Treaty and is the only one to have completed the
dismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that
have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including
India and Pakistan, which have announced their intention
not to carry out any more nuclear tests.
Another objective here would be a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for military purposes. I
proposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of
the Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we
should launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-
discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give
new impetus to disarmament.
We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of
chemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the
Convention banning chemical weapons becomes universal
and that the Convention banning biological weapons is
made truly effective through a verification mechanism.
Combating the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles
capable of delivering such weapons, while preserving
useful civilian applications.
In order to make progress in conventional
disarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention
providing for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel
mines comes into force as soon as possible.
Sixth, we should continue to combat
underdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no
further demonstration. France remains heavily committed;
it is the second largest provider of official development
assistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more
effective, France has decided to reform its cooperation
arrangements and increase coordination with other donors
— in the first place with the European Union. More than
60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European
Union. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin
America and the second largest to Asia.
France would like development resources to be more
predictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals
that we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the
idea of a development account. We encourage the United
Nations to continue its discussions in this area.
Seventh, we need to work with the non-
governmental organizations. They are capable of sounding
the alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very
practical terms to help build States governed by the rule
of law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the
activities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission
on Human Rights and in the various United Nations
agencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the
human rights dimension into their activities.
After more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will
see the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of
human rights. This is a crucial text because these are the
rights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.
17


However, even if we reinforce the Security Council,
strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better
handle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this
will still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and
for that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide
regulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.
The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in
all its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International
Criminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive
negotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against
the impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of
the first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential
synthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and
strikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the
powers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the
spirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those
countries that still have reservations will be able to join us.
In another field of law, the International Labour
Organization has taken a historic step towards universal
compliance with basic labour standards through the
declaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is
a commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the
Organization.
On 11 November 1997 the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted
the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and
Human Rights. This is the first normative framework to
guide the international community in an area of scientific
research where advances are already shaking our traditional
concepts of life and social organization. France is
submitting a draft resolution calling on the General
Assembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.
Ninth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of
organized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of
illegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8
per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the
International Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations
represent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross
domestic product.
At the special session in New York in June we
decided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for
drugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let
us do so.
Tenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,
whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.
The recent International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step
forward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the
means to hunt down those who finance and instigate these
attacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal
convention against the financing of terrorism.
We need to define concrete mechanisms for legal
measures and mutual judicial assistance against those who
finance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure
or the freezing of the assets of organizations or
individuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be
provided for. Innovative measures, such as making it
impossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies
investigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we
have the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at
the end of the present session of the General Assembly.
President Clinton spoke here on Monday of this
common struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.
In addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that
breed terrorism.
The eleventh point I would like to make concerns
the remedy for not only the current financial crises, but
also the malfunctioning of the international financial
system as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the
increasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial
globalization is running wild now. New means urgently
need to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to
make its contribution. We need also to define new rules
adapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today
presenting to its European partners some proposals to
counter international financial instability.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) must
naturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be
more legitimate and more effective, working on the basis
of clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,
cooperating with other competent bodies, organizing
dialogue between industrialized countries and emerging
countries, ensuring the transparency of the financial
system and reflecting the economic, social and political
realities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect
early warning signs to prevent crises from happening.
Within this transformation, to which the Director-
General of the IMF is making an important contribution,
and also in order better to stabilize the international
economic and monetary situation and to support world
growth, Europe will play an increasingly important role
18


since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,
the euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.
From this period we are living through, which is so
full of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and
of crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular
those made under the aegis of the United Nations,
additional progress must be forthcoming in building a more
just and more peaceful world, because this is what we all
want.
Today’s world needs rules. The United Nations must
remain the unifying framework, and the Charter must
remain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its
worth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of
regulation — these are three main areas for our work.








Today’s world offers
one clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work
together better. That much is clear.
We share a global environment. We depend on each
other for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts
affect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the
shadows of drugs and terrorism.
We can no longer separate what we want to achieve
within our own borders from what we face across our
borders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently
can inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear
together.
And if our finance, our trade, media,
communications and even our culture are, day by day,
more and more transnational, it would be strange and
potentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in
the old compartments built just after the Second World
War. If the challenge is international, then the response
must be international too. We must launch a new era of
international partnership in which we modernize those
institutions that allow us to cooperate and to work
together.
The United Nations has a real record of
achievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has
had its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively
when brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered
words when action was needed.
But the United Nations is no more than its Member
States. Its failures are our failures. The values of the
United Nations Charter are as valid now as when they
were written. But we have to find new ways of applying
them.
So I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe
it must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the
United Nations need proper accountability to go with
secure funding, better management and more effective
coordination in all their activities.
Our Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is
now up to us, the Member States, to give him our full
support. We must not allow reform in the United Nations
to falter.
And let me emphasize today that we need to
strengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This
means broadening its composition: new permanent
seats — for the developing world as well as for Germany
and Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an
unacceptable compromise. We have been talking about
this now for five years. It is time for decisions.
28


We face many challenges, but none more immediate
than the contagion of recession spreading from those
countries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world
economy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to
impose new panoplies of controls on international capital
movements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we
must all recognize that the absence of proper financial
structures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled
with a lack of transparency, will be punished by the
markets sooner or later.
However, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms
to support a process of change: rules to encourage greater
transparency in international and national financial dealings;
better supervision and regulation of financial operators;
adequate resources for the international financial institutions
to deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform
programmes for countries in difficulty, programmes that
take account of the social effects of the restructuring we are
asking for.
The only way to tackle such complex problems is a
new, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global
problems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the
G-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary
look at the international financial architecture and how it
can be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe,
for us all.
However, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this
cannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting
the financial framework right is only a start. We must
create the conditions for sustainable development in all our
countries.
The international community has set itself exacting
targets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion
of people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our
own development effort is now geared to the eradication of
poverty. I told last year’s special session that we would
reverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently
we have announced that we are raising our development
budget by £1.6 billion, and our support for health,
education and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We
have helped pay for the World Health Organization’s
campaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our
money where our mouth is.
Of course, however, these development programmes
only work if the conditions are right, and too much money
has been wasted over the years. That is again why the work
the United Nations is doing to create strong development
partnerships is so important and must be given our full
backing. I call today on all parts of the United Nations
system, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the
World Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective
coordination of their development efforts. The poor of
this world will otherwise be the losers.
If we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to
ensure that the least developed countries benefit from this
global economy. That means, for example, letting them
sell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It
means actively helping them benefit from globalization.
And it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.
The European Union is committed to zero tariffs for
these countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all
developed countries to follow suit.
We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest
countries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to
speed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are
genuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year
2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have
embarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with
the aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But
we need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge
collaborative effort between the countries represented here
today will be needed.
Development must not be at the expense of the
environment. We all know this. But, again, this is a
challenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run
thing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work.
Countries with the biggest emissions must come forward
quickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto
commitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a
consultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.
And I hope that others will come forward and do the
same.
The world has high expectations of the United
Nations as the guardian of global peace and security. The
United Nations should not get involved if regional
organizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But
sometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.
And if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles
must be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.
First, prevention is always better than cure. The
resources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to
the expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.
The United Nations is building up its capacity in this
29


area, but it needs more support — and again Britain
pledges to play its part.
Secondly, where we do have to send in the Blue
Helmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task.
There must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers
were inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe
areas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.
United Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well
as a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and
clear and effective command.
Thirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and
respond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating,
underpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are
trying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armed
forces following our Strategic Defence Review is
transforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-
reaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics
capability.
I can announce today that within six months we will
conclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to
ensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer
when it is needed — the first such agreement by a
permanent member.
Fourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from
the start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic
institutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security
Council has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not
simply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the
United Nations, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will
be asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals
dealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to
make this a reality.
Too many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few
higher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes
region. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent
deadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern
Ireland, and the support of the world community in our
doing so has given us great strength and courage to carry
on. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope
that the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for
a further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we
in Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.
I want to focus, however, on one other area of
urgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet
again, the security forces of President Milosevic´ are
ignoring the clear will of the international community and
inflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to
see as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the
unacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army have contributed to the present appalling situation.
But nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible
creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
We have some clear responsibilities in this situation
as an international community. First, we must make it
clear that our patience with broken promises — phoney
assurances that are not honoured — is exhausted.
Continuation of military repression will inevitably lead to
a new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on
both sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic
appreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a
mutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it
clear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian
needs of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any
means necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can
see just over the horizon as winter approaches.
We propose a new Security Council resolution
calling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an
urgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants
of Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President
Milosevic´ would ignore such a resolution at his peril.
The international community faces another serious
challenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in
insisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United
Nations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an
important agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the
United Nations Special Commission earlier this year.
Again, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will
play our part in ensuring that it is.
Finally, we face two global scourges which can
undermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life:
drugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links
between drugs and crime and instability in so many
countries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on
all who come near them — growers, smugglers, pushers
and users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every
link of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing
sight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we
are honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking
losing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a
30


further £200 million at the national level on our priorities,
but our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.
We are not short of organizations looking at this
problem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are
desperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating
illicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug
dealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against
organized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary
for the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that
those countries root out the traffickers and their dirty
money — hit the drug barons where it hurts. The
convention will provide practical means to achieve this, but
the negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task
of completing them by the millennium, at the latest.
The fight against terrorism has also taken on a new
urgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includes
Luxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others.
Each one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric
and cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists
are no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that
terrorism should have no hiding place and no
opportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no
let-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators
justice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless
terrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.
As a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up
to the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists
have no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain,
just passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle
terrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we
must go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if
we all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the
recent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-
raising for terrorism on an international basis. As
Chairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high-
level conference in London this autumn to deny the
terrorists this means of support. Effective new measures
on an agreed international basis could make a real
difference.
I have covered many points in my speech to the
Assembly, but my main point is really a very simple one.
We face multiple new challenges as we approach the new
century. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these
challenges successfully is tackling them together. We
need effective international cooperation and modern
institutions to deal with our political problems and our
economic problems. We need the United Nations system
pulling together as never before. We need to revitalize
and modernize our international institutions to deal with
the crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need
political will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our
modern world are too pressing, their consequences too
immediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate
or to look away any longer. We are being given a
warning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving
these challenges we face together, or pay the price. And
the time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now.I congratulate you, Sir, on
your election to the presidency of the General Assembly
at its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our shared
endeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full
cooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for
his commitment and contribution, and to commend him
for his work throughout the last year.
I first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister
in 1977. Since then I have for many years had the
privilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but
without ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with
gratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.
To me, this also signifies the consensus on the national
interests and the foreign policy of India. When I
addressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many
ways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata
Government was a coalition of many factions, which
united in the restoration of our people?s faith in
democracy. Since then we have had many changes of
Government, but the people?s political awareness and
their faith in the institutions which uphold our
constitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when
I come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on
behalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that
democracy can take root in a developing country. I am
confident that the Indian experience will prove that
democracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term
economic growth in developing societies. That is the path
that the people of India have chosen, and I stand before
the Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent
India.

The world of the 1970s has receded into history. The
shackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The
distinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the
spread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we
have been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.
From this flows our desire to see the democratization of the
United Nations itself. An international body that does not
reflect, and change with, changing international realities
will inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore
support a revitalized and more effective United Nations,
one that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast
majority of its Member States and is better equipped to
meet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first
century.
The Security Council does not represent contemporary
reality; it does not represent democracy in international
relations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the
freedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has
acted only when it was convenient for its permanent
members. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to
the Security Council — and there are other examples too.
Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior
political priorities and perceptions.
There is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The
Security Council must be made representative of the
membership of the United Nations. Developing countries
must be made permanent members. This is a right to which
the developing world is entitled. The presence of some
developing countries as permanent members is inescapable
if the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be
effectively discharged, particularly when we see that the
Council acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It
is only natural that on decisions affecting the developing
world, these countries should have a say, on equal terms.
Along with other measures, the Security Council too must
be reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so
that more developing countries can serve on it. But that
alone is not enough, because as long as effective power in
the Council rests with the permanent membership, the
interests of the developing world will not be promoted or
protected unless developing countries are made permanent
members on a par with the present permanent members.
Only this will make the Council an effective instrument for
the international community in dealing with current and
future challenges.
The new permanent members must of course have
the ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with
permanent membership. India believes it has that ability,
and, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are
prepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent
membership, and believe we are qualified for it.
It will be a great day when democracy becomes the
universal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that
democracy in its institutions and functioning. However,
open democratic societies have one scourge to contend
with: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine
and other democracies is to maintain our openness,
safeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no
quarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have
recounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted
worldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes
open societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit
almost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the
most serious threats to civilized societies. Events since
then, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka
aircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the
recent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only
established the correctness of that judgement.
Terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.
Terrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the
most vicious among international crimes, and the most
pervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of
men and women in open societies, and to international
peace and security. In India, we have had to cope with
terrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for
nearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but
none should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush
this challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.
Today, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and
with money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone
global and it can only be defeated by organized
international action.
Let us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism
is a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly
stand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of
the international community. It should be the primary task
of all open and pluralist societies to develop collective
means for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in
Durban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called
for an international conference in 1999 to develop such a
collective response. We earnestly recommend that the
1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an
international convention to provide for collective action
17


against States and organizations which initiate or aid and
abet terrorism.
Now, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization
that economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights
form a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations
of economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to
violations of civil and political rights. In defining its index,
the Human Development Report gives a higher weighting
to economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting
is reduced for developed countries, highlighting the
importance of the right to development for developing
societies. It is therefore a matter of concern that the
absolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the
promotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right
to development.
India has ratified both the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in
our country — the National Human Rights Commission, a
free media and an independent judiciary — all serve to
ensure that the rights set out in international human rights
statutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain
convinced that unless progress is made on economic, social
and cultural rights, including the right to development, the
world will continue to witness international conflict leading
to migrations, displacement of people and human rights
abuses.
In the closing years of the twentieth century, the
challenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities
facing the international community. We have successfully
prohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent
decades. The present century has witnessed the
development and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We
must ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass
destruction is not carried into the next century.
For the last half-century, India has consistently
pursued the objectives of international peace, along with
equal and legitimate security for all through global
disarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of
our national security. India has, over the years, sought to
enhance its national security by promoting global nuclear
disarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear
weapons would enhance both global security and India?s
national security.
The negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that
such a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the
process of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the
enhancement of international peace and security. India
participated actively and constructively in the
negotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a
disarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a
time-bound programme for the universal elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
It is a matter of history that India?s proposals were
not accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted
by India on grounds of national security. We made
explicit our objection that, despite our stand having been
made clear, the Treaty text made India?s signature and
ratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful
of its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us
to stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a
limited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11
and 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring
a credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security in
the foreseeable future.
These tests do not signal a dilution of India?s
commitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.
Accordingly, after concluding this limited testing
programme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on
further underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed
our willingness to move towards a de jure formalization
of that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has
already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In
1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as
such a restraint would have eroded our capability and
compromised our national security.
India, having harmonized its national imperatives
and security obligations and desirous of continuing to
cooperate with the international community, is now
engaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range
of issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring
these discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the
entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond
September 1999. We expect that other countries, as
indicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it
without conditions.
After protracted discussions, the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin
negotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production
of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
18


explosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is
a partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded
and enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear
arsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in
good faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-
discriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. India
will pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives
in this area during the course of the negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament.
As a responsible State committed to non-proliferation,
India has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons
or related know-how to other countries. We have an
effective system of export controls and shall make it more
stringent where necessary, including by expanding control
lists of equipment and technology to make them more
contemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear
India. At the same time, as a developing country, we are
conscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful
applications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively
with other countries in this regard, in keeping with our
international responsibilities.
A few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in
Durban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an
international conference be held, preferably in 1999, with
the objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of
this millennium on a phased programme for the complete
elimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members
of the international community, and particularly the other
nuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us
pledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium
it will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall
never again be subjected to the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons.
The decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of
expectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the
global economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that
heralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way
to caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian
flu is now spreading to other continents.
The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would
foster economic development, with the global financial
markets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What
we have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtual
money” that has not been generated by productive
economic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” is
real, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms
are unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement
in and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run
follows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment,
with results that are self-reinforcing. In developing
countries and in western financial capitals, there is now
a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of
capital markets has been a primary cause of the current
crisis.
Does it mean that the world should turn back from
globalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Rising
economic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the
technological imperative, but we must learn how to
manage the change. India has not been affected as
severely as some other countries, largely because we
adopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in
commodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a
reduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by
50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth
everywhere, including in the developed world.
I must emphasize that democratically elected
leadership in an open developing society such as India
also faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled
free market system aggravate existing economic and
social disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to
reduce disparities, thus creating a more stable
environment in the long term. Such policies are necessary
in accountable democracies and are in no way
inconsistent with managed liberalization.
It is high time that we begin a new international
dialogue on the future of a global and interdependent
economy. This is a task for the sovereign States
represented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics
of an unregulated market place.
I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are
on the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase,
but we are all aware that an exciting new universe is
within our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton
described his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the
beach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was
modest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but
I believe that we are now actually sailing
in the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries
and will make many more which will move humankind
forward.
And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not
well. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all
parts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface
tranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and
19


seek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and
unhealthy exclusivism.
India has a message — not a new one, for almost all
religions have expressed the thought before. But we have
preserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in
our daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to
be a better place than the world we have seen so far, these
values must prevail. History also shows that these are easier
to prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards
ever closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The
world and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the
occasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is
the task before us, and I declare India?s readiness to make
its full contribution in the testing times ahead.
I close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved as
composed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest
language in the world:
“Svastir manushebhyaha
Oordhvam Jugatu beshajam
Sam no astu dvipathe
Sam Chathusthpate
Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti”
This means: Let all human beings be blessed with
prosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all
creatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all
two-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-
legged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.







As the Prime Minister of
Israel, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned,
encouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80
years ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That
extraordinary recognition by the international community
confirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for
two millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and
the land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish
State in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.
Religious and non-religious people alike have viewed
this rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the
vision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle
occurred, we have all been hoping that it would be
accompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:
“nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible,
Isaiah 2:4)
It was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel
stretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our
Declaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half
a century later, as we view with pride our nation?s
extraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are
determined to complete the circle of peace around us. No
people have suffered more from war and violence than the
Jewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I
know that that is not a common perception of us. I,
personally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing
could be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of
battle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small
children at home. I want a future free of war — a future of
peace, for them and for Palestinian children like them.
We want peace for us and for the Palestinian people,
whose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel
consequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing
to make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the
Palestinians are ready to make those necessary
compromises as well. What is at stake is our life together
in a very small land, and there is no reason that we should
not be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons
and daughters of Abraham.
As we search for peace, we naturally encounter
crises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles — that is
inevitable in any negotiating process. But only
negotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which
is not the result of negotiations is an invitation to
continued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence
and threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e
option of violence must therefore be totally discarded and
permanently disavowed.
Peace will be achieved only by heeding the call
made by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in
Jerusalem, “No more war. No more bloodshed”.
The Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was
a historic turning point which changed the face of our
region. It has benefited both countries and brought hope
to all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a
model peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?s
contribution to this peace, his devotion to the
advancement of our relationship and his efforts to help
the peace process with the Palestinians have been
invaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am
sure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments
represented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein
our most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete
recovery.
I believe we can achieve a successful peace
agreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that
peace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The
first is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not
last. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.
None of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the
Jewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish
State, I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself,
regardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those
who do not share this responsibility.
The second principle of a durable peace is
reciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can
be successful. The agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the
Palestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which
they live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks
against Israel from those territories. Israel has been
fulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the
Palestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the
Palestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank,
are now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the
13


attributes of self-government: they have their own flag,
their own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and
their own police force.
It can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is
occupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.
But we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten
our lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we
approach further redeployment.
The territory we are negotiating about is virtually
uninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a few
thousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is
the canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history
have been etched. And it has powerful implications for our
security. We should remember that at its widest point Israel
is all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West
Bank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance
would be reduced to the distance between this building and
La Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders
would put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are
prepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated
risks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch
of this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally.
Every stone and every hill and valley that I have walked —
I know them intimately, as do my people — resonates with
our forefathers? footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish
civilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the
sages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time.
Yet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we
have agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of
this hallowed land, provided that the principles of security
and reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain
the ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would
fulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun
violence and fight terrorism.
Under the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I
signed, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat
agreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest
and prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect
and dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over
wanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the
numbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not
been done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious
daily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are
Sesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to
become suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for
war, not for peace. And they agreed that they must
complete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which
can only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That
Charter is still on the books and still on the Internet — if
representatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for
Israel?s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a
euphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our
Palestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. You
cannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”.
Of course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is
also a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this,
as President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very
podium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism
rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous
is that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic
interpretation of Islam, which is very distant from
enlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is
one of the world?s great religions, and we have
admiration and respect for its institutions and its
teachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion
betrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines
Arab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace
of the world.
For terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be
punished and deterred, and the climate of support they
enjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only
way that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested
and that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.
The elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead
to prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based
regional economy between Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the
barriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint
business ventures between the parties. Trade between
Israel and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the
last two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If
things are better for them economically, things are better
for us. I should like to give an example relating to the
transfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian
workers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown
enormously in the last two years. Three years ago we
transferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian
Authority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.
This year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is
almost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives
do not know that; none of them knows that we have
dramatically improved the Palestinian economy because
we believe that life better for them is life better for us.
The absence of violence will enable all of us,
Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I
may add, Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far-
14


fetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach a
standard of living and quality of life now considered
unimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will
begin negotiations for the final settlement — a final
settlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.
I urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I
regret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is
long overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates
in the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them
was met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not
put an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not
about meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach
a peace agreement through negotiations.
An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
State, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would
constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It
would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly
urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such
actions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our
part, and that development would not be good for the
Palestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace.
We must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously
and tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No
other way will do.
What would such a peace look like? I envision its
success would lie in ensuring the following balance: the
Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives
and none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will
have control of all aspects of their society, such as law,
religion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture;
tourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.
What they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a
right to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become
the base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We
have a right to ensure that it does not become a base and
haven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a
base — in New York city terms — five blocks away, and
without the East River. We are talking about something that
is not hypothetical.
As I prepared this speech, I was informed of a
terrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem, in a bus
station. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be
sure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not
violent — a peace without terror, which is the only peace
that means anything.
Nor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such
as anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and
airfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv
airport — as many have in the past — their planes could
be endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent
peace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal
weapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent
status negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will
strike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli
security. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and
negotiation alone. There is no other way.
Negotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon
and Syria as well. As representatives know, over six
months ago our Government announced an initiative to
implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our
decision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw
from south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:
that there would be security arrangements to ensure the
safety of the civilian population on both sides of the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
I can report that I find myself now in the bizarre
position of offering to withdraw from an Arab country
and meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a
withdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.
We have not abandoned this initiative.
Peace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the
circle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the
achievement of a lasting peace in our region requires
addressing the ominous existential dangers which still
threaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran
and Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional
weapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran
has just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.
Iraq has declared that it will no longer accept
international inspections of its non-conventional
programmes, inspections mandated by Security Council
resolutions.
These developments threaten not only Israel, but all
the nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the
rogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass
destruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to
world peace, than anything we have known in the past. I
want to caution members about something else: to let
sweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction
is to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is
required instead is concerted international action to
prevent disaster.

That, after all, is what this body was established to do.
And if it is to live up to its founders? expectations, it will
have to be far more adept at distinguishing between
fanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe
that the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace
and stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation
of the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid
Conference. By addressing such issues as regional
economic development, arms control, the resolution of
refugee problems, water and the environment, these
committees can produce the important building blocks of
peace.
But ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial
decisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East
themselves. They must decide whether the region will
continue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a
full participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy.
Cooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading
position in the world of the next millennium. Violence,
terrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.
Deep in our hearts, we know which choice we want
for our children. My wife and I hope that when our two
little boys grow up, the only competition they will engage
in with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian
and Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields
and in debating societies.
It is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.
It is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made
it possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite
the most horrific calamities to befall any people or any
nation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have
to human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is
reflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate
the Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our
eternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our
neighbours and to all present here today: “May the year and
its maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings
begin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year.













May I start, Sir, by
congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of
this great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides
its deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,
Uruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth
and hospitality on that occasion.
I would also like to express our thanks to his
predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with
considerable commitment, presided over the introduction
of many important reform measures during the past
session.
Each year this debate provides an opportunity to take
a longer perspective on the United Nations — to look
back and, of course, to look ahead. We have
achievements to acknowledge and challenges for the
future to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by
present-day conditions. We are living in very difficult
times. The economic events that have unfolded over the
last year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a
global impact. They will affect developed and developing
countries alike across most regions of the world. The
problems that face us demand a calm and steady response
if financial troubles are not to spill over into wider
instability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and
a test of the component parts of the multilateral system.
This year we mark 50-year milestones in two major
areas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish
this half-century from earlier times: international
peacekeeping and the development of international human
rights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the
challenges of the present day. Both typify the unique
contribution of the United Nations system. It is in this
global setting that universal international norms can be
established. The international rule of law gives us a
framework with which to deal confidently with the
7


problems that confront us. And it is through collective
security that the countries of the world can work together
to promote and reinforce peace and stability.
New Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset
valued the opportunities for global debate and collective
action provided by the United Nations. We are committed
to the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective
operation is essential to the well-being of our world.
We are, of course, as many are, conscious of the
criticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in
recent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was
very high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding
a new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the
decade there was talk of a new world order.
But the world community?s expectations of what could
be achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own
political will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,
which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,
proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to
respond effectively.
Euphoria about the United Nations began to give way
to cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the
United Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a
longer view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is
the appropriate reaction.
Since the end of the cold war the United Nations
peacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.
There have been some marked successes and, regrettably,
some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping
mandates must reflect the lessons learned.
The need for the United Nations to be able to carry
out its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to
what it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the
blue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive
timely reimbursement.
The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and
the regular budget cast a long shadow over the
Organization. Dues outstanding at present have reached
alarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and
small nations.
We cannot afford to have the capacity of the United
Nations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.
In my own area of the South Pacific we developed
a regional response to a regional problem. I am referring
to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an
island which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but
has enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the
Governments of the region that set out to help the
Government of Papua New Guinea and representatives of
the Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.
The contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon
Islands and my own country have played a valuable and
significant role, and there is now growing hope and
confidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for
almost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing
the ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations
participation. We welcomed the United Nations decision
to set up a small political office on the island. This
commitment by the United Nations will help strengthen
the peace process there.
Today the world faces uncertainty caused by the
financial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the
Russian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin
America under pressure and is now touching just about
everybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and
the reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has
dramatically changed economic and social prospects.
World economic growth this year will be significantly
reduced.
This most serious economic situation in many years
has the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must
cooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national
level we must take the actions required, not just for our
own sakes but in the interests of the broader international
community. This includes refraining from protectionist
reactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing
ahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.
A serious challenge is to ensure that economic
insecurity does not threaten political and social stability.
We must resist pressures to take political actions that we
would normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is
through a collective approach to the problems that
confront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in
the United Nations system and elsewhere and build
confidence in our joint ability to work through difficult
times.
I was particularly struck by the comments of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in
his statement on Monday. His characterization of the
8


crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social
or political, but all of these things at once — is exactly
right. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s
conclusion that we must address the crisis on all these
fronts.
As a forum for debate, and as a body capable of
taking global action, the United Nations, together with its
specialized agencies, has an important role to play in
building capacity and providing social support where it is
needed. Much of what the United Nations has achieved
provides the norms and mechanisms to help us through
difficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The
challenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle
the problems that have the potential to undermine our
security, problems that have their greatest impact on
ordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the
time to go backwards.
Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
have underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from
over. The response to terrorism must be decisive and
unequivocal. The international community has a duty to
ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.
Universal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist
instruments must be a fundamental objective of all
Members of this Organization.
War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a
resurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New
Zealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes
Tribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not
enough. New Zealand has long called for an international
criminal court that would have jurisdiction over such
crimes. We commend the effort of those who, through
much hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the
Statute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.
It is our expectation that, with the support of the
international community, the Court will prove an effective
tool in the fight against those who carry out appalling
atrocities.
Nowhere is the need for multilateral action more
clearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental
degradation and promote sustainable development.
New Zealand is honoured to have our own
Environment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair
the Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh
session. It is our strong hope that this session will see us
advance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards
achieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years
ago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of
the Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and
seas and the review of the Barbados Programme of
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States in preparation for next year?s special
session of the General Assembly.
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted last
December was a positive first step in dealing with this
quintessentially global problem. There remain some
important implementation issues to be resolved. The
Fourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will
provide an opportunity to make further progress.
Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,
we now have an Organization that is efficient and
effective. There is more to be done if this great
Organization is to meet the challenges of the present day:
changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from the
administration of the Organization to its front-line work
in development and confronting global problems.
New Zealand looks forward to continuing the
dialogue on financing for development. Through our
current membership of the Economic and Social Council
we have followed closely the evolving debate on this very
important issue. We very much welcome the initiatives
taken by the Organization towards closer linkages with
the Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are
themselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the
present economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge
they have ever had. However, we must decide whether in
their present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first
century.
This Organization, too, like any other, needs to
respond to changing circumstances, and be flexible
enough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world
of today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.
The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need
to address anew the divide between North and South. The
United Nations development role is crucial. Once again I
believe the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head
when he described in his statement on Monday the need
to restore development to its proper place in global
economic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up
trade and investment flows, and promote access to
information and technology. All of these are tools with
which to fight the economic downturn which is
confronting us.

The United Nations clearly has the leading role to play
in development. Other international institutions play a
complementary part. I am personally conscious of the
particular contribution made by the Commonwealth through
the recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That
Mission highlighted the special vulnerability of small
States, which has led to the establishment of the
Commonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which
will have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social
Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.
Within the United Nations we need to correct the
North-South imbalance to which I referred through reform
of the Security Council. More equitable representation on
the Council would better reflect the world as it is and
today?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex
issue, but there has been some good progress this year in
the equally important area of reforming the Council?s
working methods. Altogether, these are matters which
require careful consideration and negotiation. Setting
artificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform
package would not be helpful and could in fact prove
damaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the
support of the greatest possible number of Member States.
I should add that regional groups in the United
Nations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly
open to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to
create a more equitable distribution of electoral
opportunities and to recognize modern-day political and
economic linkages.
In the field of disarmament and arms control, it is
timely to consider how far we have come and what we
have achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end
of nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm
was shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising
grave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken
some encouragement from statements made in this Hall in
recent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which
all countries that have not yet done so will sign up
unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty.
The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to
proceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off
treaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations
concluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping
back from the objective of complete disarmament, including
the elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s
commitment to this objective was reiterated in the
declaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers
of seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand
is now working with those countries on a draft resolution
based on the concerns outlined in the declaration.
One achievement which I personally see as a top
priority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification
protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
Their Destruction. Following a very successful initiative
from Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of
ministers who this week issued a statement urging
Governments to commit themselves to completing this
task.
New Zealand supports the actions of the United
Nations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of
weapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to
the security of the region. We urge the Government of
Iraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission so that the elimination of these
dreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security
Council can once more address the question of lifting
sanctions.
In the 50 years since Member States adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance
of the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time
again. Yet there remains much to be done before the
vision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be
realized for all. We are confident that, under the
leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
we will continue to make good progress towards the
realization of that vision.
The United Nations can add value in promoting and
protecting fundamental human rights standards,
emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have
been supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this
area, and we will continue to do so.
We see countries in all regions of the world seeking
the international community?s support as they build
structures to provide good governance and deliver hope
and greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am
encouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra
Leone in this regard.
As the last 50 years have demonstrated, this
Organization has added a whole new dimension to
10


cooperation among nations. No lesser body could have
achieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it
will be the dramatic development of the international rule
of law and the evolution of collective approaches to
security, both political and economic, which will
characterize our era. In other words, that really is the work
of the United Nations.
Now, with the challenge of the economic problems
that face us, we nations of the world are more dependent
than ever on solving our shared problems together. New
Zealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations
and to the ideals that this Organization stands for.









Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds
of the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on
all of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding
collectively to new challenges and in establishing a
reliable system of international security and stability once
we have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes
accumulated during the century about to end.
This is not only possible, it is the imperative of our
times!
A well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would
live in the world, live in peaceâ€. It contains a highly
philosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will
live in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve
emerging problems through peaceful, political means.
States will live in peace and harmony once they have
recognized their interrelationship and interdependence and
started to seek collective responses to the challenges of
their times.
Experience confirms the truth of this popular
wisdom. The most recent example is the sharp
aggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis
which has besieged many countries, including Russia,
which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The
current upheaval in the world financial markets can be
overcome only by joint efforts that do not pursue
unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global
economic stability. Interaction of States in this process,
including within the framework of the United Nations,
must, on principle, be raised to a new level.
As for Russia, after overcoming an acute political
crisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the
Government and the leading political forces are making
vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial
situation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be
found.
From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not
deviate from the path of reform and will do its best to
pass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to
preserve the democratic progress that has been made but
also to augment it.
Likewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain
consistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards
building a democratic multipolar world, ensuring
interaction with other States in the interests of settling
international problems by political means and developing
broad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.
20


We are convinced that the problems before the world,
no matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the
basis of strict observance of international law and close
interaction among States. Multilateral organizations and
mechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.
Above all, this applies to the United Nations, which
continues to be the sole universal international
peacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than
any other world body to reach agreements on how to settle
conflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying
social and economic causes. It is important for United
Nations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional
organizations.
We highly value the level of interaction that now
exists between the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a
reliable partner in addressing complex European problems,
as well as interaction with the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The
international community has developed a unique arsenal of
political and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of
every international problem. It must be put to effective use.
Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last
resort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of
international law and above all by the United Nations
Charter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of
law rather than the law of force in international affairs.
The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this
year was settled precisely by political means, through the
joint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by
the United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic
evidence that the potential inherent in constructive and
active diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying
exclusively on military force.
A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us
deeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious
consequences for regional and international stability. No
doubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
implement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the
other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the
situation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of
mass destruction and answer the question of whether or not
that country still poses a threat to regional and overall
international security after seven years of work carried out
there by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the
world community is required today to finally unblock this
crisis situation.
Political logic must prevail over the logic of force in
our search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in
Kosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the
Kosovo conflict might lead to a major war with
unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and
Europe at large. It is our firm belief that a political
solution is the only possible way of settling the problem
of Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict
respect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.
The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of
the fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary
gains can be obtained in that country through the use of
arms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for
political solutions, with the United Nations playing a
central role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,
formation of an efficient central Government recognized
by all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs
territorial integrity and independence can realistically be
accomplished.
Collective political efforts are required to give a
second wind to the Middle East peace process. In our
view, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or
proposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has
stymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should
not be ignored that even if the Middle East process has
long-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has
consistently advocated the establishment of an
independent Palestinian State through political means and
negotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable
rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable
assurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be
realized.
In a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results
already achieved.
The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie
case has been a major accomplishment of the international
community. The adoption by the Security Council of a
relevant resolution was possible due to the constructive
approach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United
States, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due
to diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,
which were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed
without delay to its implementation.
21


Arguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the
efforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The
United Nations must play a leading role to this end.
Failure of the international community to fully
extinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in
Africa in recent years is a source of growing concern.
Moreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that
continent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to
achieve full coordination between the United Nations and
Africaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is
why the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on
Africa should focus on shaping a strong common stance
capable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of
Africaâs latest developments.
For objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention
to settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in
Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or
Trans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”
namely, promoting a political settlement and helping build
lasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia
has undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is
doing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can
prove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show
goodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more
meaningful international backing, above all from the United
Nations and the OSCE.
While making strong efforts to settle regional crises,
we should not lose sight of global problems, some of which
have acquired a new dimension in the last year.
We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of
a real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the
international community to encourage all countries to
accede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.
Russia is committed to the idea of continued reduction
of nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic
stability at lower armament levels. In this context, we
attach particularly great importance to the Russian-
American interaction in the area of reducing strategic
offensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,
Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian
Government, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to
seek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II
Treaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to
ratify all documents related to START II.
Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear
arms control process is now on the agenda. We urge
careful consideration of a proposal made by President
Boris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy
nuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of
their national territories. We note with satisfaction the
recent consensus decision in the Conference on
Disarmament to start negotiations banning production of
nuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of
special significance is that the decision was supported by
States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are
convinced that such a ban would be a further necessary
step in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation
regime and nuclear disarmament.
The nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear
terrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed
to be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our
regret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the
international community is required to prevent the real-
life emergence of that new form of terrorism.
Accelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts
of nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it
can be adopted by the General Assembly at the current
session, has become particularly relevant.
Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its
firm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. International terrorism is one of the most
dangerous global challenges to international stability. It
can be successfully combated only through united action
by all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of
making unilateral power moves, shall we be able to
succeed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.
Militant separatism has become another factor that
destabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on
extremist methods in the struggle for the national rights
of minority groups within multinational States, separatism
often finds itself in league with terrorism and religious
fanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal
conflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get
involved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional
crises.
More than two and a half thousand national
minorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of
them to aspire to a State entity of their own, the
disastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be
imagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that
in mind.
22


The fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted
action. We must focus on the practical implementation of
the relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat
adopted by the General Assembly at its special session.
The international community should take a common
stand in implementing the provisions of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary
occurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is
needed in respect of those States which, under various
pretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and
freedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards
involving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level
of Government policy discrimination against a part of the
population. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking
citizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia
and Estonia. The international community, and above all the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
should closely watch the situation in those countries.
I have touched upon a few of the important issues
which the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this
time. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of
joint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal
with urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that
end, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms
and adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the
process of reforming the United Nations, launched by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The
rationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the
Organization.
That is the angle from which we approach the ongoing
discussion on the work of the Security Council. No one
should question the Security Councilâs primary
responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of
peace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its
effectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well
as to build on internal cohesion and work coordination
methods developed in recent years.
I should like to reaffirm that we support the
implementation of reforms and changes in United Nations
mechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the
United Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps
taken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United
Nations auspices, of the Statute of the International
Criminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on
ways to achieve international information security serves
the same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset
threats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science
and technology for purposes incompatible with the
maintenance of international security.
I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of
adapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of
an individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for
example, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in
mind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security
Council, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive
measures. We must not allow a precedent to be created
involving the use of military potential in a crisis situation
without the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is
obvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion
of the existing system of international relations, whose
central element is the United Nations.
United Nations sanctions as an instrument of
international coercion also require a highly balanced
approach. When introduced by the Security Council,
sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that
may be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.
They should not destabilize the economic situation in the
country subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.
It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the
imposition of sanctions and their duration and the
procedures for easing and lifting them.
In short, individual elements of the United Nations
mechanism need improvement and retooling. But we
should go about it with a full sense of responsibility,
mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary
harm is to be avoided at all costs.
Every session of the General Assembly is, in a way,
a milestone event. Each session is expected to make a
tangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems
confronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether
or not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly
lives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It
will depend on all of us whether or not joint effective
steps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful
world, a world free from war and conflict and from
financial and economic upheaval, a world built on the
principles of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands
ready to work with others to attain these goals.






Let me begin by thanking the
Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by
noting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.
Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United
Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode
into war, all around the world. And today more people
determine their own destiny than at any previous moment
in history.
We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more
widely embraced than ever before. On every continent
people are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and
a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United
Nations.
Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise
of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil
today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets
and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from
this economy have a special responsibility to do more to
minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global
markets to all citizens. And the United States is
determined to do that.
We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious
and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many
States to acquire such weapons.
And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not
fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a
continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which says
9


“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
person.”
Here at the United Nations, at international summits
around the world and on many occasions in the United
States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in
detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing
and what we must yet do to combat terror.
Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why
all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of
our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern
to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted
over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi
Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own
citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public
buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives
to building bridges between nations — people very much
like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred
against the United States.
Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with
a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in
promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We
love our country for its dedication to political and religious
freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights
of the individual. But we know that many people see us as
a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they
find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots
elsewhere.
But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we
believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue
our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us
to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our
backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own
opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace
a victory they must never have.
Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as
only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a
clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and
innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the
people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the
people of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American
killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500
more injured — innocent people going about their business
on a busy morning.
Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where
the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants
alike — mostly children and women, two of them
pregnant — people out shopping together when their
future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the
past.
Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin
gas in the Tokyo subway.
Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car
bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos
Aires.
Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by
ancient animosities that cry out for resolution.
Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year
after year, for all their progress towards peace.
Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of
unfathomable terror with still no end in sight.
Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second
President to assassination.
Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,
Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where
innocent people have been victimized by terror.
None of those victims were American. But every
one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or
mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s
hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never
be the same.
Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,
of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the
number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,
sometimes less than the number of people killed by
lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point
in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the
1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater
openness and the explosion of information and weapons
technology. The new technologies of terror and their
increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility
of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to
chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing
each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a
threat to all humankind.
Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is
an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to
measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb
10


threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;
the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so
hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or
child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the
rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so
crucial to peace and prosperity.
In every corner of the world, with the active support
of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build
better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with
their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from
around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in
Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday
Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that
cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure
each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But
what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle
East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements
have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many
businesses will never be created in places crying out for
investments of time and money? How many talented young
people in countries represented here have turned their backs
on public service? The question is not only how many lives
have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were
lost in their aftermath.
There is no justification for killing innocents.
Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and
righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to
understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of
course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen
that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate
act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing
came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the
Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards
peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this
stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,
after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and
thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their
own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases
terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.
We must also acknowledge that there are economic
sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses
of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the
siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing
social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor
can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents
is not a social programme.
Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does
not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that
foster it. The most recent United Nations Human
Development Report suggests the gulf is widening
between the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work
harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into
the poison of hatred.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only
revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must
show people they have everything to gain by embracing
cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply
an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s
responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to
spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to
build new, open economies. Developed nations have an
obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of
prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week
ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international
economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens
within them.
Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line
centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of
civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate
in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an
inevitable clash between Western civilization and values
and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is
terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any
religion to justify whatever political objectives they
have — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the
world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,
grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding
of Islam.
A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from
Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United
States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.
There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the
United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The
6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there
is no inherent clash between Islam and America.
Americans respect and honour Islam.
As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and
around the world, I see again that we share the same
hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to
provide for our children, to follow the faith of our
choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and
to pass on brighter possibilities to our children.
Of course, we are not identical. There are important
differences that cross race and culture and religion which
demand understanding and deserve respect. But every
11


river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in
America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all
Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our
increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of
friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will
continue to look for common values, common interests and
common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit
expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for
prayers by people assembled together are twice those for
prayers said at home.”
When it comes to terrorism, there should be no
dividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and
Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and
emerging countries. The only dividing line is between those
who practise, support or tolerate terror and those who
understand that it is murder, plain and simple.
If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and
should be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are
the concrete steps we can take together to protect our
common destiny? What are our common obligations? At
least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,
no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on
States that do; to act together to step up extradition and
prosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to
strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce
the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger
domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of
explosives; to raise international standards for airport
security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and
despair.
We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and
law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist
networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of
those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our
embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I
will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to
repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the
worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in
Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.
But no matter how much each of us does alone, our
progress will be limited without our common efforts.
We will also do our part to address the sources of
despair and alienation through the Agency for International
Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in
Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue
our strong support for the United Nations Development
Programme, the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United
Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World
Food Programme. We also recognize the critical role
these agencies play and the importance of all countries,
including the United States, in paying their fair share.
In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new
terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or
political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as
a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of
the future, between those who tear down and those who
build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and
community.
The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be
strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning
to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important
that we do this together.
Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the
Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many
speeches in support of the United Nations when it was
just beginning,
“All agreements and all peace are built on
confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot
get on with other people in the world unless you
have confidence in them.”
It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s
problems to have confidence in one another. It is not
necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have
confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that
we understand every single difference among us to have
confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we
affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together
we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a
throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can
meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears
with confidence.









Mr. President, may I take this
opportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa
and as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to
extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election
to the high post of President of the General Assembly.
You will be presiding over this august Assembly of
the nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and
decisions will be of the greatest consequence to the
continuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global
peace and prosperity.
The Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own
country, which is a proud member of that Movement,
invests great trust in this Organization to discharge its
responsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical
period of its existence.
Quite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly will be remembered through the ages as
the moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the
Nazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration
held high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be
built on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in
each of its clauses.
For those who had to fight for their emancipation,
those such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had
to free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights served as the
vindication of the justice of our cause.
At the same time, it constituted a challenge to us
that our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to
the implementation of the perspectives contained in the
Declaration.
Today we celebrate the fact that this historic
document has survived a turbulent five decades, which
have seen some of the most extraordinary developments
in the evolution of human society.
These include the collapse of the colonial system,
the passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in
science and technology and the achievement of the
complex process of globalization.
And yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who
are the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent
conflicts.
They have, as yet, not attained their freedom from
fear of death that would be brought about by the use of
weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional
arms.
Many are still unable to exercise the fundamental
and inalienable democratic rights that would enable them
to participate in the determination of the destiny of their
countries, nations, families and children and to protect
themselves from tyranny and dictatorship.
The very right to be human is denied every day to
hundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and
the unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs,
water and shelter, education, health care and a healthy
environment.
The failure to achieve the vision contained in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic
expression in the contrast between wealth and poverty
which characterizes the divide between the countries of
the North and the countries of the South and within
individual countries in all hemispheres.
It is made especially poignant and challenging by the
fact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the
perpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State
and intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the
democratic right of many across the world, all result from
acts of commission and omission, particularly by those
who occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the
economy, and in other spheres of human activity.
13


What I am trying to say is that all these social ills,
which constitute an offence against the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result
of the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the
deities.
They are the consequence of decisions which men and
women take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom
will not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the
vision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
This Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely
because the founders of this Organization and the nations
of the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of
fascism, including many that still had to achieve their own
emancipation, understood clearly that our human world was
an interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of
happiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity
have a universal application, because each people and every
individual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly
say it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where
others, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted
with misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation.
Thus can we say that the challenge posed by the next
50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
by the next century whose character it must help to fashion,
consists in whether humanity, and especially those who will
occupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to
ensure that at last we build a human world consistent with
the provisions of that historic Declaration and other human
rights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.
Immediately, a whole range of areas of conflict
confronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are
familiar with these, which range from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own
continent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan,
Tajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.
Clearly, this Organization, and especially the Security
Council, acting together with people of goodwill in the
countries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act
decisively to contribute to the termination of these
destructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to
defeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of
arms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice
can be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes
are necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.
As Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General
for the contribution he has made to help us find the way
towards ending violent strife on our continent. We have
taken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts
to banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the
report from page to page, but I will try to do so.
The very first resolution of the General Assembly,
adopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge
of
“the elimination from national armaments of atomic
weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable
to mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c))
We must face the fact that after countless initiatives
and resolutions, we still do not have concrete and
generally accepted proposals supported by a clear
commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy,
final and total elimination of nuclear weapons and
nuclear-weapon capabilities.
We take this opportunity to salute our sister
Republic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge
all others that have not yet done so to follow this
excellent example.
In an honest attempt to contribute to the definition
of the systematic and progressive steps required to
eliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation
which they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil,
Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and
Sweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First
Committee for consideration by the Assembly. It is
appropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free
world: the need for a new agenda”.
I call with all humility on all Members of the United
Nations seriously to consider this important draft
resolution and to give it their support. We must ask the
question, which might sound naive to those who have
elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal
to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass
destruction — why do they need them, anyway?
In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to
explain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the
consequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the
use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of
some States over others.
14


Urgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and
permanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the
realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of
Palestine and respect for the independence and security of
all the States of this important region. We also look
forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of
Western Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is
possible to take these matters off the world agenda on the
basis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples
concerned.
Similarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken
by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this
supremely important country of Africa, to enable it to
return to democratic rule and a system of governance
directed at serving the interests of all its people.
Together we are also faced with the scourges of drug
abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized
transnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly
support the measures adopted or being discussed by the
United Nations to deal with these challenges and commit
our country and Government to cooperate fully in all
regional and international initiatives to ensure that the
peoples of the world, including our own, are spared the
destructive impact of these crimes.
The world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as
President Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has
plunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and
disoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep
personal disappointment to tens of millions of people
around the world.
President Clinton also said:
“Recent press reports have described an entire
generation working its way into the middle class for
over 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty
within a matter of months. The stories are
heartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live in
the lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families
who owned their own homes, sent their children to
college, travelled abroad, now living by selling their
possessions.”
President Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” in
the world economy
“have brought or aggravated problems in Russia and
Asia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin
America to South Africa”,
and he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic
theory.
He further recognized that with a quarter of the
world’s population in declining growth, the United States,
in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’s
words,
“ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growth
at home depends upon growth abroad”.
I have quoted the President of the United States at
such length both because he is correct and because he is
the leader of the most powerful country in the world.
Accordingly, we would like to believe that with the
problem facing all humanity, and especially the poor,
having thus been recognized, courage will not desert the
powerful when it comes to determining the correct course
to be taken, and following this course, addressing the
challenge that has been identified.
The tragedy President Clinton describes goes far
beyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to
which he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the
condition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of
ordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of
poverty around the globe has been brought into sharp
focus by the destructive fast movements of currents of
wealth from one part of the world to another.
Put starkly, we have a situation in which the further
accumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the
improvement of the quality of life of all humanity, is
generating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.
The imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death
matter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to
ensure that the countries of the South gain access to the
productive resources that have accumulated within the
world economy should not be avoided by seeking to
apportion as much blame as possible to the poor.
Clearly, all relevant matters will have to be
addressed, including such issues as greater inflows of
long-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;
technology transfers; human resource development; the
emancipation of women and the development of the
young; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS
epidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening
of financial and other institutions relevant to sustained
economic growth and development.
15


Fortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work
will also have to be done to restructure the multilateral
financial and economic institutions so that they address the
problems of the modern world economy and become
responsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.
Similarly, this very Organization, including its
important Security Council, must itself go through its own
process of reformation so that it serves the interests of the
peoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for
which it was established.
The issues we have mentioned were discussed in a
comprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference
of the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban,
South Africa, earlier this month.
I am privileged to commend the decisions of that
important meeting to the General Assembly and the United
Nations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration,
which the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that
the decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will
greatly assist this Organization in its work and further
enhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the
solution of the problems that face the nations of the world,
both rich and poor.
This is probably the last time I will have the honour
to stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.
Born as the First World War came to a close, and departing
from public life as the world marks half a century of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that
part of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it
should be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and
tranquillity in the village of my birth.
As I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as
its hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has
emerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region,
on my continent and in the world, which will not allow that
any should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any
should be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should
be condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should
be stripped of their human dignity, as we were.
I will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance will
strike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the
changing seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a
realizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of
the aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity.
Then would history and the billions throughout the world
proclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we
toiled to give life to a workable dream.














I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his
assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at
its current session. I believe that his wisdom and
experience will enable him to accomplish his important
mission with distinction.
I would also like to express my appreciation for the
contribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the
General Assembly during the previous session.
At present, the international situation is undergoing
profound changes. The accelerated trend towards
multipolarity has injected new vitality into international
relations. Economic globalization is developing very
quickly, and countries are becoming increasingly
interdependent. The development of multipolarity and
globalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment
of international relations.

Bilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-
confrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against
third countries, have been established one after another.
Various regional and intercontinental organizations of
cooperation have become more active than ever before.
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,
pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute
to peace and development as well as to the establishment
of a fair and equitable new international political and
economic order.
10


However, we cannot lose sight of the many
uncertainties still existing in the world.
The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In
the post-cold-war period of today, the people of all
countries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.
It is to be regretted that last May India conducted
nuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus
adversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.
Soon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear
tests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the
tension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy
blow to international nuclear disarmament and the
mechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This
has aroused the great concern of the international
community. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully
implement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, as well as the provisions
of Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their
plans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and
unconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and
Pakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir
through peaceful means.
In our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,
the international community faces the pressing task of
consolidating and strengthening the international non-
proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of
nuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority
of the NPT.
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,
the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly
that a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons
should be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the
Chinese Government has on many occasions called on all
the other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and
nuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a
convention on no first use of nuclear weapons through
negotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a
fissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the
negotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign
the Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the
Chinese Government that China will abide by the
provisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming
nuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies
of unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and
unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will
continue to support the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory
and verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis
of the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the
largest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear
disarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its
responsibility.
The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July
1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of
many countries of the region. Its negative impact is still
spreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen
since last June has added to the difficulty of economic
recovery in the region.
The crisis occurred in the overall context of
economic globalization, and its impact is being felt across
the world. Stepping up international cooperation and
putting an early end to this crisis is not only in the
immediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also
in the interests of the international community as a whole,
and especially of the developed countries. We hope that
those developed countries with important influence on the
region’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and
take active, resolute and effective measures to make their
due contributions to safeguarding the stability of the
financial order and promoting the recovery and
development of the region’s economy.
Following the eruption of the East Asian financial
crisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly
responsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the
countries concerned within the framework arranged by
International Monetary Fund and, at the same time,
through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall
interests of maintaining the stability and development of
the region, China has made the decision not to devalue
the yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great
pressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the
growing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to
maintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain
unchanged.
Fighting with one heart and one mind, we won the
battle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a
series of measures to deepen our reform and expand
11


domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of
our economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise
in this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believe
that with the common efforts of the countries in the region
and of the rest of the international community, the East
Asian economy will be able to gradually get out of its
predicament and return to the road of sound development.
The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate
for some time, which has aroused widespread concern in
the international community. We are of the view that the
Arab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic
negotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental
interests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive
to world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties
concerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible
and pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the
peace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and
on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and
the agreements already reached. The Chinese Government
will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and
the efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant
parties to this end.
We are following the developments in the Kosovo
region of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the
parties involved will solve the problem through political
dialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the
Balkans have been hard won and should be cherished all
the more by the relevant parties and by the international
community.
The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are
another source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will
be appropriately resolved by the parties involved through
peaceful means.
The twenty-first century is greeting us. On the
threshold of the new century, the United Nations bears
heavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world
peace, promoting human progress and establishing a just
and rational new international political and economic order.
It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end
of the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints
and more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented
opportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and
can use its own advantages to play a unique and
constructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable
world, in establishing a new type of international
relationship based on friendship and cooperation and in
taking up the common challenges facing mankind.
China has consistently held that it is necessary to
carry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that
the Organization can better keep abreast of the changing
situation and serve its numerous Member States. We have
taken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform
in a number of fields promoted by all Member States.
Some reform measures and recommendations proposed by
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been
approved by the General Assembly and are now being put
into practice. Intense discussions on reform of the
Security Council are also in orderly progress. At present,
there are still differences among Member States on quite
a few issues involved in the reform of the Security
Council. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive
approach and play an active part in the relevant
consultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement
of relevant issues.
Here, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the
Chinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of
the Security Council bears on the interests of all countries
and so requires a democratic style of work and extensive
and full consultations. All Member States should have an
equal right to speak on the question of the reform, and
their reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.
Secondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich
countries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet
the concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more
attention should be given to the interests and aspirations
of the vast number of developing countries.
Representation should be balanced between the developed
and the developing countries.
Thirdly, the reform measures are of major
significance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the
Security Council in maintaining international peace and
security. They should be worked out on the basis of the
realities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course
that the objective of the reform of the Security Council is
to solve problems rather than to create new sources of
discord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security
Council gains extensive support from Member States, it
is essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously
promoted the advancement and development of the cause
12


of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in
Asia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from
colonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark
system of apartheid, won basic political rights and became
an equal member of the international community. The
United Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international
instruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the
Right to Development, further enriching the content of
human rights. The right to development has been
universally recognized in the international community as an
inseparable part of basic human rights.
In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken
place in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the
introduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed
an ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved
legal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the
rights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese
people now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality
than ever before and a much fuller and more settled life
than in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to
make unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to
strengthen the legal system, while developing the economy
so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to
the full.
The Chinese Government is active in supporting and
participating in the activities of the United Nations in the
field of human rights. China has all along stood for
international cooperation in the field of human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance
understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground
and strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese
Government is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and
cooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,
with human rights organizations at the national and
international levels.
Last October, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese
Government has decided to sign it early next month. This
once again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese
Government with respect to promoting and protecting
human rights. China is ready to continue to work with other
countries to maintain and increase the current positive
momentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote
the furtherance of the world cause of human rights.
This year is the twentieth anniversary of the
introduction of the policy of reform and opening up in
China. In these two decades, China has scored
tremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and
modernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our
national economy has gained a favourable momentum of
high growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened
reforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last
September, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth
National Congress, formulated a blueprint for China’s
cross-century development based on the new
developments both on the domestic and international
scene. In March this year, our new State institutions and
new Government were formed through elections at the
first session of the ninth National People’s Congress of
China. We will build energetically on our political and
economic restructuring and carry forward the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
twenty-first century in a comprehensive way.
China’s modernization drive requires a stable
international environment of peace. China will continue to
pursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This
policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in
independence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard
world peace, and to seek common development.
To persist in independence and maintain the
initiative, we always put our State sovereignty and
national security first and never develop relations with
other countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred
territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the
upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide
useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,
adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and
one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang
Zemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait
relations and promoting the process of peaceful
reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and
resolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of
Taiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and
Taiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.
We respect the sovereignty of other countries and
vigorously support the efforts of all countries in the
world, and of developing countries in particular, to defend
their State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our
own. In handling international relations, we adhere to
non-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of
Third States. We do not go in for military blocs and the
13


arms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China’s
development will not pose a threat to any other country.
The so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded and
fabricated with ulterior motives.
To safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for
the maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is
our consistent view that State-to-State relations should be
handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful
coexistence, transcending differences in social systems and
ideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests
and, at the same time, respect those of others and
continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by
seeking the convergent points of common interests. With
regard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary
to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and
strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by
resorting to force or the threat of force.
It is essential to completely reject the mentality of the
cold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve
international and regional security issues through consensus
and participation on an equal footing. We in China stand
for the equality of all countries, big or small, and for
accelerated democratization of international relations. World
affairs should be handled through consultation by all
countries, and no country should impose its own will on
others.
To seek common development, peace is the
prerequisite of development and development is the basis of
peace. In today’s world, where the economy is increasingly
globalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order
to achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside
world is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As a
huge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of
the trend of economic globalization and be even more
active in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop
trade and expand scientific and technological exchanges
with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches
importance to and actively participates in the activities of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)
and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the
establishment and development of friendly exchanges and
cooperation with other global and intercontinental or
regional organizations for economic cooperation.
China continues to take a positive attitude towards
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to
unremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified
for entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations
have dragged on and on with no decision having been
made. China is a developing country, and we can
negotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis,
in accordance with the principle of balancing rights and
obligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned
will take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up
excessive demands and work for an early conclusion of
the relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO will
benefit all its members and make the multilateral trade
mechanism complete and more balanced.
Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to
use the forum of the United Nations to brief you on
China’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing
to such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,
catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,
Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the
submerged regions, the duration of the floods and the
seriousness of the disaster they caused were something
rarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of
people’s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government
mobilized forces from all sectors across the country and
organized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out
battle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the
assaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the
safety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and
major cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of
life and property was kept to a minimum.
At present, the Chinese Government is sparing no
effort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has
started reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We
are taking every measure possible, with full confidence,
to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread
epidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and
that none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas
will drop out from school or be deprived of education. In
the course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the
great flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to
push forward our reform and opening up and the socialist
modernization drive.
Since China was hit by the disastrous floods, a
number of countries and international organizations and
communities have sent messages to express sympathy and
solicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.
I wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people, our most sincere
gratitude to them.
The world of today is a world of interdependence.
The promotion of peace, cooperation and development has
14


become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and
work together to bring into the twenty-first century a world
of peace, security and stability in the interest of
development.











I congratulate
you, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good
fortune and all of us a successful session.
I should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for
the dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-
second session. He advanced the reform process at the
United Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must
follow up these efforts.
This session of the General Assembly has a special
significance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to
the day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became
the first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of
Germany to address the United Nations. When he described
our perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant
more than the mere security of States, more than the mere
regulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what
it is all about is the beginning and the objective of any
rational policy â€” people.
That description of our role in the United Nations
remains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a
world free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law,
a world in which every individual has his opportunity and
which preserves the integrity of Creation for future
generations. It is the vision enshrined in the International
Bill of Human Rights.
We have come a lot closer to that vision over the past
25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world
has been healed. The world is developing ever more into
the â€œone worldâ€ on the foundations of democracy and
human rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that
the human race has never been so bound up together in its
common destiny, united by common challenges, as it is
today.
The crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world
economy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime
and terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The
year 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of
Bangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in
China have claimed thousands of lives.
No State, whether super-Power or small island State,
can master these global challenges alone. And no one can
escape them, least of all the suffering people: the
homeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the
victim of civil war in Africa.
We can shape our future only through joint efforts.
We therefore need global action and global management
for the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not
tomorrow or the day after, but today.
This is a test not only for Governments but also for
the other global players: the non-governmental
organizations and the multinational corporations. Never
were the non-governmental organizations so important as
they are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention
banning landmines could not have been signed in
December 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the worldâs
hundred largest economic entities are now companies, and
only 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has
come for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity
throughout the world.
The age of globalization is the age of the United
Nations. Only here do all nations of the world come
together. Only here can we find joint solutions to the
global challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we
Germans want to help get the United Nations in shape for
the twenty-first century. We are facing up to this
responsibility â€” as the second largest export nation and
the third largest economy in the world, and as the country
with the largest population in the European Union.
We owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude
and support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the
Member States. The Security Council still mirrors the
world as it was at the end of the Second World War, but
not the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the Caribbean.
The same is true of the greater weight of Japan and
united Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that
advocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security
Council. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any
longer; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that
would be bad indeed.
16


Since the ending of the cold war the United Nations
has had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore
needs effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right
to expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and
especially the big members, must help according to their
ability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish
its tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will
continue to meet its obligations.
We know from recent experience that we should not
add to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.
This is a task especially for regional organizations like the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If
they succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security
Council will not need to deal with them. I think that would
be very well-advised, because it would free capacities for
all of us.
New avenues of joint action are therefore called for.
To pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.
Only those who face up to the challenge can exploit the
opportunities and cushion the risks.
The impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that
the world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not
to say we need a global financial authority or fixed
exchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism.
But we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more
transparency and more efficient banking systems, especially
in the newly emerging economies.
This is not a task for Governments alone. What is
needed now is a global public-private partnership between
Governments, international financial organizations and
corporations. We therefore support the American initiative
for a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging
economies on a new international financial architecture. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
should not always have to serve as the stopgap when the
opportunity for structural reforms has been missed.
Managing globalization also means weaving a network
of partnerships between the big regional groupings and the
big countries. The regional groupings are the components
of a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.
The European Unionâs partnerships with regional
organizations like the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market
(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We
want an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism.
I am confident that the European Union will be an
anchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By
introducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is
focusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is
about to begin further negotiations on accession with
associated partners. What Willy Brandt said about
Germany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:
â€œWhat belongs together is now growing togetherâ€.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too
is also gradually opening its doors to the new
democracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will
admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together
with Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of
Independent States members, we are developing a
comprehensive security partnership.
True, the Russians are having a rough time at
present, but the world needs a democratic and stable
Russia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate
with its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a
Herculean task of consolidating the economy and
maintaining social stability. All those responsible must
face up to the challenge: the President, the Government,
the parties and business. Of course, the regions too are
called upon.
I know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov
last week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to
change course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia
affects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count
on us.
The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâs
side. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the
word is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than
250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations,
the European Union, the United States and Russia are
coordinating their efforts to enable those who have been
driven out to return to their villages.
Time is getting short; winter is just around the
corner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that
the international community will react with military force
if necessary. We still seek a political solution for
Kosovo â€” self-administration within the Yugoslav
Federation. However, this cannot be achieved without
Belgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be
silenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav
security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The
recent reports we have received from Kosovo are very
17


disappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not
true.
NATO is prepared to provide the backing for a
political solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of
Europe. Their future can only be a European one. The
history of Europe in this century shows that we can
overcome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the
willingness to do so.
In Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being
replaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my
twelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly
beginning to blossom again, and the countryâs
reconstruction is progressing.
Nonetheless, the peace process must continue to be
buttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR),
for the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the
result of the elections, the international community will not
tolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace
agreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until
the presumed war criminals and enemies of peace â€”
Mr. Karadzic and his lot â€” have been brought to trial in
The Hague.
Only when those guilty of crimes against humanity,
torturers and terrorists all over the world, have been
brought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.
Thus, the establishment of the International Criminal
Court on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in
which the force of law, not the law of force, prevails.
Germany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to
sign and ratify the Courtâs Statute.
No one stands more at the mercy of those who wield
power than refugees. At present more than 20 million
people worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people,
women, children; people who are sick, homeless and
destitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to
happen to them.
Over the last several years I have been to many
refugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East.
Every refugeeâs case is a story of immeasurable human
suffering.
Germany is now the country with the second largest
number of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees
have found refuge in Germany.
The suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and
political challenge to the international community as a
whole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee
policy. The United Nations, too, has to do something
about it.
Specifically, this means, first, a more equitable
distribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the
General Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest
countries to their own devices in trying to cope with the
refugee problem.
Secondly, greater efforts will have to be made to
remove the causes of flight and expulsion.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the
twenty-first century a century of prevention, and with
good reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that
people have to take flight is to make oneself partly
responsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.
This is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights
observers and peacekeeping forces.
Striking at the root of mass flight and migration also
means eliminating the economic, ecological and social
causes. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The
wealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume
86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3
per cent.
This equity gap must be closed. Every individual has
a right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want.
All nations must be given a fair chance in global
competition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up
to the rich countries to help the poor make the most of
their opportunities for development.
Our aim is a social world market economy. This is
why in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks
on bilateral and multilateral assistance measures â€” an
investment in peace and stability.
Africa shows what can be achieved when the
international community and the countries concerned pull
together. Today, democratic elections are held in more
than half of the African countries. In 20 African countries
economic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11
it is higher still.
We want the Africans to know that we will not
abandon that vast continent and its 800 million people,
despite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.
18


Poverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating
the situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in
the Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything
else on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.
The Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each
other again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.
We Europeans will continue to support this process
with our American friends. We back Israelâs legitimate
claim to security for its State and citizens.
The Palestinians have recognized that claim; now
words must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that
terrorism has no chance.
But Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a
further partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new
obstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowing
new settlements in the occupied territories.
Particularly in the Middle East, we have time and
again seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction
and suffering. We must pit all our strength against the
cynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues;
the dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a
warning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must
be brought to justice.
Drying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty, ethnic
conflict and fundamentalism â€” is our common
responsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.
Islam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be
further from the truth than the clichÃ© that Islam is
synonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human
rights.
We want a dialogue of cultures and religions,
especially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity
that unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable
dignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights
covenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks
for our joint action in the twenty-first century.
Violations of human rights are no longer an internal
matter of States. They concern us all. Any group which,
like the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human
rights places itself outside the international community of
common values.
The world of tomorrow will be judged by how we
treat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.
Yet the rights of many children are still being trampled
underfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a
life in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.
Particularly appalling is the fact that every year
some two million children all over the world are sexually
abused. Only through joint action can we stop child
prostitution, traffic in children and child pornography,
including that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore
propose that the United Nations set up a contact point to
coordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of
children. The optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child designed to afford better protection
against sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and
quickly put into effect.
Children are small people who need big rights.
Protection for children during armed conflicts must be
improved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers.
We all hoped that with the ending of the East-West
confrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would
be gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The
threat of proliferation of means of mass destruction
hovers over the human race. We can safeguard world
peace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such
terrible weapons under control.
In Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to
negotiations on a cut-off. Thatâs a good sign, but not
nearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all
nations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. This also applies to the conventions banning
chemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a
verification protocol to the Biological Weapons
Convention is now urgent.
Next March the Ottawa Convention imposing a
worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into
force â€” a great success. Only if all countries now sign
the Convention will these diabolical devices soon be
wiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task
to get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using
state-of-the-art technology.
We must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.
The victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a
warning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we
owe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our
blue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.
19


Take the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched
a global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.
But time is getting short. We have just had the warmest
half year this century. At the fourth session of the
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires
in November, we shall have to agree on the instruments
with which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.
Take water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more
important than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in
short supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or
none at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions
for the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source
of life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.
The pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed
to spark fresh conflicts.
Germany intends to remain in the vanguard of the
international campaign to protect the environment. I am
gratified to note that our commitment has been
acknowledged by the appointment of Klaus TÃ¶pfer as
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment
Programme.
But we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few
days ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam
on early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The
conference has shown that progress can be achieved if we
want it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing
effective global early-warning systems for environmental
crises and natural disasters, and developing emergency
management arrangements for the coordination of
international relief measures. We must now get down to
this task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so.
Four hundred and sixty three days from now the
twentieth century comes to an end â€” a century of
unprecedented violence and destruction. The coming
century must be a century with a humane countenance.
What a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not
enough. Only if we act together will we survive together.
The United Nations is indispensable to this task.
Strengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable
world â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming
generations. My country will devote every possible effort
to this task.








Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,
on your election, which attests to the high regard in which
the international community holds you and your country,
and which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,
welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session
of the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead
to the strengthening of the Organization.
It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the
peoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person...to
establish conditions under which justice...can be
maintained, and to promote social progress”.
That immense ambition was justified by the recent
horrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from
happening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a
superhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert
Camus put it:
”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time
to accomplish, that’s all.”
A long time has elapsed, and we are still working on
that, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what
we have done as the United Nations throughout these 53
years, of what the Security Council and successive General
Assemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-
General — in particular the current one over the last two
years, whose work has been so outstanding.
Over the decades, the Security Council, except when
paralysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed
to shoulder its primary responsibility for international
security. When it failed to do so, no other institution was
able to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50
years ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations
of this kind.
The institutional framework established by the
Charter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from
cold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,
proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne
out in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when
the Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in
Africa, during the creation of the United Nations Mission
in the Central African Republic, which was the first
entirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and
even in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted
to the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its
objective.
And yet, as the Secretary-General himself
emphasized recently,
“Unpredictability and surprise have become almost
commonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1),
and the illusions of the end of the cold war have not
stood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge
this fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.
Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some
States take advantage of circumstances and deliberately
carry out archaic policies of force that contravene the
principles of the Charter. On other occasions, the
abdication or implosion of States has released among
various groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very
much alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these
are destabilizing factors which, while very different, all
help to disorganize and imperil international relations.
Several major crises have proved this recently. The
Asian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,
when badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world
that is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive
reactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid
spread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is
exchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of
money that are greater than the means of intervention of
all the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those
amounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.
Today, they are 15 times greater.
The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic
reminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute
combined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity
could open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.
In East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of
a border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven
States are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory
15


of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization
is threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I
cannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,
civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve
more than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.
Twenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and
returnees — have been affected by these conflicts and
require assistance from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active
in 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;
slavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;
disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.
But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of
woe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which
is the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very
moment trying to maintain peace on four continents with
approximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17
operations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20
agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.
Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in
1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.
I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the
multilateral system do not today have the necessary means
to meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not
give up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our
action?
Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,
we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our
institutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security
Council a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the
case of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and
acts of aggression”.
Nothing can justify the use of force by a State, a
group of States or an organization, however powerful, if
prior authorization was not received from the Security
Council — except in cases of self-defence.
My country shares the impatience of those who
deplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution
to various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where
the humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November
1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put
forward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its
other partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground
for a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for
the return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible
use of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to
forgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after
this case there would be another exception, and then
another. Little by little, any country would declare itself
entitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or
ambitions so required, and we would have to begin all
over again. We must remain firm on this principle.
Second, we must make sure that the authority of the
Security Council is respected and its resolutions are
complied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today
the question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.
The lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s
resolutions, been made subject to the controlled
dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must
therefore meet these conditions — completely meet them,
but only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim
must be to reintegrate Iraq into the international
community, starting with the region.
The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s
complete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all
the resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which
means Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United
Nations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s
disarmament.
The third need is to increase the representativeness
of the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.
This is why my country has come out in favour of
enlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,
new permanent members — two seats for the North, to
which Germany and Japan have every claim, and three
for the South; on the other hand, there should be new
non-permanent members for the North and South. This
enlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s
effectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its
responsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third
session of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.
Fourth, we must increase the capacity of our
Organization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is
much to be done. Now that the international community
has just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the
peace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in
Madrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,
and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France
continues to support the persevering efforts of the United
States Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left
without any prospects at all should those efforts
unfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac
and President Mubarak have proposed in that event
convening a conference of countries resolved to save the
16


peace. This concern for the future has been very well
received. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working
to further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of
meeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a
just and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and
agreements that have been reached.
Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As I
mentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo six or seven African States of the
Great Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle
of problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,
ethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so
forth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each
of these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a
regional solution. That is why my country has raised again
the idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes
region, which we suggested as early as 1995. The
conference would be placed under the aegis of the United
Nations or the Organization of African Unity, with the
active participation of the States of the region. Several
African diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We
support those efforts.
Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us
pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s
representatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of
Matre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.
Fifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral
disarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the
nuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone
recognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime
and pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear,
conventional, chemical and biological.
Our primary objective here should be the entry into
force as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United
Kingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the
Treaty and is the only one to have completed the
dismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that
have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including
India and Pakistan, which have announced their intention
not to carry out any more nuclear tests.
Another objective here would be a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for military purposes. I
proposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of
the Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we
should launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-
discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give
new impetus to disarmament.
We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of
chemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the
Convention banning chemical weapons becomes universal
and that the Convention banning biological weapons is
made truly effective through a verification mechanism.
Combating the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles
capable of delivering such weapons, while preserving
useful civilian applications.
In order to make progress in conventional
disarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention
providing for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel
mines comes into force as soon as possible.
Sixth, we should continue to combat
underdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no
further demonstration. France remains heavily committed;
it is the second largest provider of official development
assistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more
effective, France has decided to reform its cooperation
arrangements and increase coordination with other donors
— in the first place with the European Union. More than
60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European
Union. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin
America and the second largest to Asia.
France would like development resources to be more
predictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals
that we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the
idea of a development account. We encourage the United
Nations to continue its discussions in this area.
Seventh, we need to work with the non-
governmental organizations. They are capable of sounding
the alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very
practical terms to help build States governed by the rule
of law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the
activities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission
on Human Rights and in the various United Nations
agencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the
human rights dimension into their activities.
After more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will
see the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of
human rights. This is a crucial text because these are the
rights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.
17


However, even if we reinforce the Security Council,
strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better
handle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this
will still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and
for that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide
regulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.
The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in
all its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International
Criminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive
negotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against
the impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of
the first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential
synthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and
strikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the
powers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the
spirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those
countries that still have reservations will be able to join us.
In another field of law, the International Labour
Organization has taken a historic step towards universal
compliance with basic labour standards through the
declaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is
a commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the
Organization.
On 11 November 1997 the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted
the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and
Human Rights. This is the first normative framework to
guide the international community in an area of scientific
research where advances are already shaking our traditional
concepts of life and social organization. France is
submitting a draft resolution calling on the General
Assembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.
Ninth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of
organized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of
illegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8
per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the
International Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations
represent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross
domestic product.
At the special session in New York in June we
decided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for
drugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let
us do so.
Tenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,
whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.
The recent International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step
forward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the
means to hunt down those who finance and instigate these
attacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal
convention against the financing of terrorism.
We need to define concrete mechanisms for legal
measures and mutual judicial assistance against those who
finance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure
or the freezing of the assets of organizations or
individuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be
provided for. Innovative measures, such as making it
impossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies
investigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we
have the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at
the end of the present session of the General Assembly.
President Clinton spoke here on Monday of this
common struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.
In addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that
breed terrorism.
The eleventh point I would like to make concerns
the remedy for not only the current financial crises, but
also the malfunctioning of the international financial
system as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the
increasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial
globalization is running wild now. New means urgently
need to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to
make its contribution. We need also to define new rules
adapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today
presenting to its European partners some proposals to
counter international financial instability.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) must
naturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be
more legitimate and more effective, working on the basis
of clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,
cooperating with other competent bodies, organizing
dialogue between industrialized countries and emerging
countries, ensuring the transparency of the financial
system and reflecting the economic, social and political
realities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect
early warning signs to prevent crises from happening.
Within this transformation, to which the Director-
General of the IMF is making an important contribution,
and also in order better to stabilize the international
economic and monetary situation and to support world
growth, Europe will play an increasingly important role
18


since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,
the euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.
From this period we are living through, which is so
full of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and
of crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular
those made under the aegis of the United Nations,
additional progress must be forthcoming in building a more
just and more peaceful world, because this is what we all
want.
Today’s world needs rules. The United Nations must
remain the unifying framework, and the Charter must
remain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its
worth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of
regulation — these are three main areas for our work.








Today’s world offers
one clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work
together better. That much is clear.
We share a global environment. We depend on each
other for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts
affect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the
shadows of drugs and terrorism.
We can no longer separate what we want to achieve
within our own borders from what we face across our
borders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently
can inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear
together.
And if our finance, our trade, media,
communications and even our culture are, day by day,
more and more transnational, it would be strange and
potentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in
the old compartments built just after the Second World
War. If the challenge is international, then the response
must be international too. We must launch a new era of
international partnership in which we modernize those
institutions that allow us to cooperate and to work
together.
The United Nations has a real record of
achievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has
had its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively
when brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered
words when action was needed.
But the United Nations is no more than its Member
States. Its failures are our failures. The values of the
United Nations Charter are as valid now as when they
were written. But we have to find new ways of applying
them.
So I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe
it must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the
United Nations need proper accountability to go with
secure funding, better management and more effective
coordination in all their activities.
Our Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is
now up to us, the Member States, to give him our full
support. We must not allow reform in the United Nations
to falter.
And let me emphasize today that we need to
strengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This
means broadening its composition: new permanent
seats — for the developing world as well as for Germany
and Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an
unacceptable compromise. We have been talking about
this now for five years. It is time for decisions.
28


We face many challenges, but none more immediate
than the contagion of recession spreading from those
countries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world
economy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to
impose new panoplies of controls on international capital
movements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we
must all recognize that the absence of proper financial
structures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled
with a lack of transparency, will be punished by the
markets sooner or later.
However, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms
to support a process of change: rules to encourage greater
transparency in international and national financial dealings;
better supervision and regulation of financial operators;
adequate resources for the international financial institutions
to deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform
programmes for countries in difficulty, programmes that
take account of the social effects of the restructuring we are
asking for.
The only way to tackle such complex problems is a
new, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global
problems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the
G-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary
look at the international financial architecture and how it
can be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe,
for us all.
However, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this
cannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting
the financial framework right is only a start. We must
create the conditions for sustainable development in all our
countries.
The international community has set itself exacting
targets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion
of people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our
own development effort is now geared to the eradication of
poverty. I told last year’s special session that we would
reverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently
we have announced that we are raising our development
budget by £1.6 billion, and our support for health,
education and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We
have helped pay for the World Health Organization’s
campaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our
money where our mouth is.
Of course, however, these development programmes
only work if the conditions are right, and too much money
has been wasted over the years. That is again why the work
the United Nations is doing to create strong development
partnerships is so important and must be given our full
backing. I call today on all parts of the United Nations
system, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the
World Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective
coordination of their development efforts. The poor of
this world will otherwise be the losers.
If we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to
ensure that the least developed countries benefit from this
global economy. That means, for example, letting them
sell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It
means actively helping them benefit from globalization.
And it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.
The European Union is committed to zero tariffs for
these countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all
developed countries to follow suit.
We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest
countries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to
speed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are
genuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year
2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have
embarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with
the aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But
we need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge
collaborative effort between the countries represented here
today will be needed.
Development must not be at the expense of the
environment. We all know this. But, again, this is a
challenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run
thing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work.
Countries with the biggest emissions must come forward
quickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto
commitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a
consultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.
And I hope that others will come forward and do the
same.
The world has high expectations of the United
Nations as the guardian of global peace and security. The
United Nations should not get involved if regional
organizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But
sometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.
And if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles
must be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.
First, prevention is always better than cure. The
resources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to
the expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.
The United Nations is building up its capacity in this
29


area, but it needs more support — and again Britain
pledges to play its part.
Secondly, where we do have to send in the Blue
Helmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task.
There must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers
were inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe
areas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.
United Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well
as a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and
clear and effective command.
Thirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and
respond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating,
underpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are
trying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armed
forces following our Strategic Defence Review is
transforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-
reaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics
capability.
I can announce today that within six months we will
conclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to
ensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer
when it is needed — the first such agreement by a
permanent member.
Fourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from
the start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic
institutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security
Council has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not
simply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the
United Nations, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will
be asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals
dealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to
make this a reality.
Too many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few
higher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes
region. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent
deadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern
Ireland, and the support of the world community in our
doing so has given us great strength and courage to carry
on. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope
that the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for
a further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we
in Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.
I want to focus, however, on one other area of
urgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet
again, the security forces of President Milosevic´ are
ignoring the clear will of the international community and
inflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to
see as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the
unacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army have contributed to the present appalling situation.
But nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible
creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
We have some clear responsibilities in this situation
as an international community. First, we must make it
clear that our patience with broken promises — phoney
assurances that are not honoured — is exhausted.
Continuation of military repression will inevitably lead to
a new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on
both sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic
appreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a
mutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it
clear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian
needs of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any
means necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can
see just over the horizon as winter approaches.
We propose a new Security Council resolution
calling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an
urgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants
of Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President
Milosevic´ would ignore such a resolution at his peril.
The international community faces another serious
challenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in
insisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United
Nations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an
important agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the
United Nations Special Commission earlier this year.
Again, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will
play our part in ensuring that it is.
Finally, we face two global scourges which can
undermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life:
drugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links
between drugs and crime and instability in so many
countries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on
all who come near them — growers, smugglers, pushers
and users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every
link of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing
sight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we
are honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking
losing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a

further £200 million at the national level on our priorities,
but our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.
We are not short of organizations looking at this
problem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are
desperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating
illicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug
dealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against
organized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary
for the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that
those countries root out the traffickers and their dirty
money — hit the drug barons where it hurts. The
convention will provide practical means to achieve this, but
the negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task
of completing them by the millennium, at the latest.
The fight against terrorism has also taken on a new
urgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includes
Luxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others.
Each one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric
and cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists
are no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that
terrorism should have no hiding place and no
opportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no
let-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators
justice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless
terrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.
As a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up
to the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists
have no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain,
just passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle
terrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we
must go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if
we all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the
recent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-
raising for terrorism on an international basis. As
Chairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high-
level conference in London this autumn to deny the
terrorists this means of support. Effective new measures
on an agreed international basis could make a real
difference.
I have covered many points in my speech to the
Assembly, but my main point is really a very simple one.
We face multiple new challenges as we approach the new
century. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these
challenges successfully is tackling them together. We
need effective international cooperation and modern
institutions to deal with our political problems and our
economic problems. We need the United Nations system
pulling together as never before. We need to revitalize
and modernize our international institutions to deal with
the crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need
political will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our
modern world are too pressing, their consequences too
immediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate
or to look away any longer. We are being given a
warning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving
these challenges we face together, or pay the price. And
the time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now.I congratulate you, Sir, on
your election to the presidency of the General Assembly
at its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our shared
endeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full
cooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for
his commitment and contribution, and to commend him
for his work throughout the last year.
I first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister
in 1977. Since then I have for many years had the
privilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but
without ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with
gratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.
To me, this also signifies the consensus on the national
interests and the foreign policy of India. When I
addressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many
ways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata
Government was a coalition of many factions, which
united in the restoration of our people?s faith in
democracy. Since then we have had many changes of
Government, but the people?s political awareness and
their faith in the institutions which uphold our
constitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when
I come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on
behalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that
democracy can take root in a developing country. I am
confident that the Indian experience will prove that
democracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term
economic growth in developing societies. That is the path
that the people of India have chosen, and I stand before
the Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent
India.

The world of the 1970s has receded into history. The
shackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The
distinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the
spread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we
have been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.
From this flows our desire to see the democratization of the
United Nations itself. An international body that does not
reflect, and change with, changing international realities
will inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore
support a revitalized and more effective United Nations,
one that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast
majority of its Member States and is better equipped to
meet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first
century.
The Security Council does not represent contemporary
reality; it does not represent democracy in international
relations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the
freedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has
acted only when it was convenient for its permanent
members. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to
the Security Council — and there are other examples too.
Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior
political priorities and perceptions.
There is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The
Security Council must be made representative of the
membership of the United Nations. Developing countries
must be made permanent members. This is a right to which
the developing world is entitled. The presence of some
developing countries as permanent members is inescapable
if the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be
effectively discharged, particularly when we see that the
Council acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It
is only natural that on decisions affecting the developing
world, these countries should have a say, on equal terms.
Along with other measures, the Security Council too must
be reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so
that more developing countries can serve on it. But that
alone is not enough, because as long as effective power in
the Council rests with the permanent membership, the
interests of the developing world will not be promoted or
protected unless developing countries are made permanent
members on a par with the present permanent members.
Only this will make the Council an effective instrument for
the international community in dealing with current and
future challenges.
The new permanent members must of course have
the ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with
permanent membership. India believes it has that ability,
and, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are
prepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent
membership, and believe we are qualified for it.
It will be a great day when democracy becomes the
universal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that
democracy in its institutions and functioning. However,
open democratic societies have one scourge to contend
with: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine
and other democracies is to maintain our openness,
safeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no
quarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have
recounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted
worldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes
open societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit
almost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the
most serious threats to civilized societies. Events since
then, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka
aircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the
recent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only
established the correctness of that judgement.
Terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.
Terrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the
most vicious among international crimes, and the most
pervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of
men and women in open societies, and to international
peace and security. In India, we have had to cope with
terrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for
nearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but
none should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush
this challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.
Today, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and
with money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone
global and it can only be defeated by organized
international action.
Let us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism
is a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly
stand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of
the international community. It should be the primary task
of all open and pluralist societies to develop collective
means for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in
Durban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called
for an international conference in 1999 to develop such a
collective response. We earnestly recommend that the
1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an
international convention to provide for collective action
17


against States and organizations which initiate or aid and
abet terrorism.
Now, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization
that economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights
form a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations
of economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to
violations of civil and political rights. In defining its index,
the Human Development Report gives a higher weighting
to economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting
is reduced for developed countries, highlighting the
importance of the right to development for developing
societies. It is therefore a matter of concern that the
absolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the
promotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right
to development.
India has ratified both the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in
our country — the National Human Rights Commission, a
free media and an independent judiciary — all serve to
ensure that the rights set out in international human rights
statutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain
convinced that unless progress is made on economic, social
and cultural rights, including the right to development, the
world will continue to witness international conflict leading
to migrations, displacement of people and human rights
abuses.
In the closing years of the twentieth century, the
challenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities
facing the international community. We have successfully
prohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent
decades. The present century has witnessed the
development and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We
must ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass
destruction is not carried into the next century.
For the last half-century, India has consistently
pursued the objectives of international peace, along with
equal and legitimate security for all through global
disarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of
our national security. India has, over the years, sought to
enhance its national security by promoting global nuclear
disarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear
weapons would enhance both global security and India?s
national security.
The negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that
such a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the
process of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the
enhancement of international peace and security. India
participated actively and constructively in the
negotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a
disarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a
time-bound programme for the universal elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
It is a matter of history that India?s proposals were
not accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted
by India on grounds of national security. We made
explicit our objection that, despite our stand having been
made clear, the Treaty text made India?s signature and
ratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful
of its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us
to stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a
limited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11
and 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring
a credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security in
the foreseeable future.
These tests do not signal a dilution of India?s
commitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.
Accordingly, after concluding this limited testing
programme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on
further underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed
our willingness to move towards a de jure formalization
of that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has
already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In
1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as
such a restraint would have eroded our capability and
compromised our national security.
India, having harmonized its national imperatives
and security obligations and desirous of continuing to
cooperate with the international community, is now
engaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range
of issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring
these discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the
entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond
September 1999. We expect that other countries, as
indicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it
without conditions.
After protracted discussions, the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin
negotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production
of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
18


explosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is
a partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded
and enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear
arsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in
good faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-
discriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. India
will pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives
in this area during the course of the negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament.
As a responsible State committed to non-proliferation,
India has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons
or related know-how to other countries. We have an
effective system of export controls and shall make it more
stringent where necessary, including by expanding control
lists of equipment and technology to make them more
contemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear
India. At the same time, as a developing country, we are
conscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful
applications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively
with other countries in this regard, in keeping with our
international responsibilities.
A few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in
Durban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an
international conference be held, preferably in 1999, with
the objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of
this millennium on a phased programme for the complete
elimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members
of the international community, and particularly the other
nuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us
pledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium
it will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall
never again be subjected to the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons.
The decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of
expectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the
global economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that
heralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way
to caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian
flu is now spreading to other continents.
The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would
foster economic development, with the global financial
markets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What
we have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtual
money” that has not been generated by productive
economic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” is
real, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms
are unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement
in and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run
follows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment,
with results that are self-reinforcing. In developing
countries and in western financial capitals, there is now
a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of
capital markets has been a primary cause of the current
crisis.
Does it mean that the world should turn back from
globalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Rising
economic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the
technological imperative, but we must learn how to
manage the change. India has not been affected as
severely as some other countries, largely because we
adopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in
commodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a
reduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by
50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth
everywhere, including in the developed world.
I must emphasize that democratically elected
leadership in an open developing society such as India
also faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled
free market system aggravate existing economic and
social disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to
reduce disparities, thus creating a more stable
environment in the long term. Such policies are necessary
in accountable democracies and are in no way
inconsistent with managed liberalization.
It is high time that we begin a new international
dialogue on the future of a global and interdependent
economy. This is a task for the sovereign States
represented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics
of an unregulated market place.
I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are
on the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase,
but we are all aware that an exciting new universe is
within our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton
described his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the
beach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was
modest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but
I believe that we are now actually sailing
in the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries
and will make many more which will move humankind
forward.
And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not
well. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all
parts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface
tranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and
19


seek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and
unhealthy exclusivism.
India has a message — not a new one, for almost all
religions have expressed the thought before. But we have
preserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in
our daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to
be a better place than the world we have seen so far, these
values must prevail. History also shows that these are easier
to prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards
ever closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The
world and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the
occasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is
the task before us, and I declare India?s readiness to make
its full contribution in the testing times ahead.
I close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved as
composed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest
language in the world:
“Svastir manushebhyaha
Oordhvam Jugatu beshajam
Sam no astu dvipathe
Sam Chathusthpate
Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti”
This means: Let all human beings be blessed with
prosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all
creatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all
two-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-
legged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.







As the Prime Minister of
Israel, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned,
encouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80
years ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That
extraordinary recognition by the international community
confirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for
two millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and
the land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish
State in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.
Religious and non-religious people alike have viewed
this rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the
vision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle
occurred, we have all been hoping that it would be
accompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:
“nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible,
Isaiah 2:4)
It was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel
stretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our
Declaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half
a century later, as we view with pride our nation?s
extraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are
determined to complete the circle of peace around us. No
people have suffered more from war and violence than the
Jewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I
know that that is not a common perception of us. I,
personally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing
could be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of
battle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small
children at home. I want a future free of war — a future of
peace, for them and for Palestinian children like them.
We want peace for us and for the Palestinian people,
whose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel
consequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing
to make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the
Palestinians are ready to make those necessary
compromises as well. What is at stake is our life together
in a very small land, and there is no reason that we should
not be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons
and daughters of Abraham.
As we search for peace, we naturally encounter
crises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles — that is
inevitable in any negotiating process. But only
negotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which
is not the result of negotiations is an invitation to
continued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence
and threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e
option of violence must therefore be totally discarded and
permanently disavowed.
Peace will be achieved only by heeding the call
made by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in
Jerusalem, “No more war. No more bloodshed”.
The Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was
a historic turning point which changed the face of our
region. It has benefited both countries and brought hope
to all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a
model peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?s
contribution to this peace, his devotion to the
advancement of our relationship and his efforts to help
the peace process with the Palestinians have been
invaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am
sure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments
represented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein
our most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete
recovery.
I believe we can achieve a successful peace
agreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that
peace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The
first is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not
last. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.
None of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the
Jewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish
State, I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself,
regardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those
who do not share this responsibility.
The second principle of a durable peace is
reciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can
be successful. The agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the
Palestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which
they live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks
against Israel from those territories. Israel has been
fulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the
Palestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the
Palestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank,
are now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the
13


attributes of self-government: they have their own flag,
their own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and
their own police force.
It can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is
occupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.
But we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten
our lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we
approach further redeployment.
The territory we are negotiating about is virtually
uninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a few
thousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is
the canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history
have been etched. And it has powerful implications for our
security. We should remember that at its widest point Israel
is all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West
Bank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance
would be reduced to the distance between this building and
La Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders
would put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are
prepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated
risks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch
of this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally.
Every stone and every hill and valley that I have walked —
I know them intimately, as do my people — resonates with
our forefathers? footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish
civilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the
sages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time.
Yet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we
have agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of
this hallowed land, provided that the principles of security
and reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain
the ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would
fulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun
violence and fight terrorism.
Under the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I
signed, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat
agreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest
and prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect
and dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over
wanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the
numbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not
been done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious
daily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are
Sesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to
become suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for
war, not for peace. And they agreed that they must
complete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which
can only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That
Charter is still on the books and still on the Internet — if
representatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for
Israel?s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a
euphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our
Palestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. You
cannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”.
Of course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is
also a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this,
as President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very
podium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism
rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous
is that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic
interpretation of Islam, which is very distant from
enlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is
one of the world?s great religions, and we have
admiration and respect for its institutions and its
teachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion
betrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines
Arab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace
of the world.
For terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be
punished and deterred, and the climate of support they
enjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only
way that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested
and that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.
The elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead
to prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based
regional economy between Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the
barriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint
business ventures between the parties. Trade between
Israel and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the
last two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If
things are better for them economically, things are better
for us. I should like to give an example relating to the
transfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian
workers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown
enormously in the last two years. Three years ago we
transferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian
Authority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.
This year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is
almost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives
do not know that; none of them knows that we have
dramatically improved the Palestinian economy because
we believe that life better for them is life better for us.
The absence of violence will enable all of us,
Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I
may add, Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far-
14


fetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach a
standard of living and quality of life now considered
unimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will
begin negotiations for the final settlement — a final
settlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.
I urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I
regret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is
long overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates
in the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them
was met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not
put an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not
about meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach
a peace agreement through negotiations.
An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
State, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would
constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It
would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly
urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such
actions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our
part, and that development would not be good for the
Palestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace.
We must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously
and tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No
other way will do.
What would such a peace look like? I envision its
success would lie in ensuring the following balance: the
Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives
and none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will
have control of all aspects of their society, such as law,
religion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture;
tourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.
What they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a
right to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become
the base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We
have a right to ensure that it does not become a base and
haven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a
base — in New York city terms — five blocks away, and
without the East River. We are talking about something that
is not hypothetical.
As I prepared this speech, I was informed of a
terrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem, in a bus
station. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be
sure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not
violent — a peace without terror, which is the only peace
that means anything.
Nor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such
as anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and
airfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv
airport — as many have in the past — their planes could
be endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent
peace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal
weapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent
status negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will
strike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli
security. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and
negotiation alone. There is no other way.
Negotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon
and Syria as well. As representatives know, over six
months ago our Government announced an initiative to
implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our
decision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw
from south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:
that there would be security arrangements to ensure the
safety of the civilian population on both sides of the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
I can report that I find myself now in the bizarre
position of offering to withdraw from an Arab country
and meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a
withdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.
We have not abandoned this initiative.
Peace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the
circle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the
achievement of a lasting peace in our region requires
addressing the ominous existential dangers which still
threaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran
and Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional
weapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran
has just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.
Iraq has declared that it will no longer accept
international inspections of its non-conventional
programmes, inspections mandated by Security Council
resolutions.
These developments threaten not only Israel, but all
the nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the
rogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass
destruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to
world peace, than anything we have known in the past. I
want to caution members about something else: to let
sweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction
is to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is
required instead is concerted international action to
prevent disaster.

That, after all, is what this body was established to do.
And if it is to live up to its founders? expectations, it will
have to be far more adept at distinguishing between
fanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe
that the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace
and stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation
of the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid
Conference. By addressing such issues as regional
economic development, arms control, the resolution of
refugee problems, water and the environment, these
committees can produce the important building blocks of
peace.
But ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial
decisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East
themselves. They must decide whether the region will
continue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a
full participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy.
Cooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading
position in the world of the next millennium. Violence,
terrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.
Deep in our hearts, we know which choice we want
for our children. My wife and I hope that when our two
little boys grow up, the only competition they will engage
in with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian
and Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields
and in debating societies.
It is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.
It is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made
it possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite
the most horrific calamities to befall any people or any
nation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have
to human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is
reflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate
the Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our
eternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our
neighbours and to all present here today: “May the year and
its maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings
begin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year.













May I start, Sir, by
congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of
this great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides
its deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,
Uruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth
and hospitality on that occasion.
I would also like to express our thanks to his
predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with
considerable commitment, presided over the introduction
of many important reform measures during the past
session.
Each year this debate provides an opportunity to take
a longer perspective on the United Nations — to look
back and, of course, to look ahead. We have
achievements to acknowledge and challenges for the
future to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by
present-day conditions. We are living in very difficult
times. The economic events that have unfolded over the
last year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a
global impact. They will affect developed and developing
countries alike across most regions of the world. The
problems that face us demand a calm and steady response
if financial troubles are not to spill over into wider
instability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and
a test of the component parts of the multilateral system.
This year we mark 50-year milestones in two major
areas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish
this half-century from earlier times: international
peacekeeping and the development of international human
rights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the
challenges of the present day. Both typify the unique
contribution of the United Nations system. It is in this
global setting that universal international norms can be
established. The international rule of law gives us a
framework with which to deal confidently with the
7


problems that confront us. And it is through collective
security that the countries of the world can work together
to promote and reinforce peace and stability.
New Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset
valued the opportunities for global debate and collective
action provided by the United Nations. We are committed
to the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective
operation is essential to the well-being of our world.
We are, of course, as many are, conscious of the
criticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in
recent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was
very high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding
a new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the
decade there was talk of a new world order.
But the world community?s expectations of what could
be achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own
political will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,
which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,
proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to
respond effectively.
Euphoria about the United Nations began to give way
to cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the
United Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a
longer view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is
the appropriate reaction.
Since the end of the cold war the United Nations
peacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.
There have been some marked successes and, regrettably,
some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping
mandates must reflect the lessons learned.
The need for the United Nations to be able to carry
out its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to
what it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the
blue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive
timely reimbursement.
The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and
the regular budget cast a long shadow over the
Organization. Dues outstanding at present have reached
alarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and
small nations.
We cannot afford to have the capacity of the United
Nations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.
In my own area of the South Pacific we developed
a regional response to a regional problem. I am referring
to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an
island which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but
has enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the
Governments of the region that set out to help the
Government of Papua New Guinea and representatives of
the Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.
The contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon
Islands and my own country have played a valuable and
significant role, and there is now growing hope and
confidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for
almost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing
the ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations
participation. We welcomed the United Nations decision
to set up a small political office on the island. This
commitment by the United Nations will help strengthen
the peace process there.
Today the world faces uncertainty caused by the
financial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the
Russian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin
America under pressure and is now touching just about
everybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and
the reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has
dramatically changed economic and social prospects.
World economic growth this year will be significantly
reduced.
This most serious economic situation in many years
has the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must
cooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national
level we must take the actions required, not just for our
own sakes but in the interests of the broader international
community. This includes refraining from protectionist
reactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing
ahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.
A serious challenge is to ensure that economic
insecurity does not threaten political and social stability.
We must resist pressures to take political actions that we
would normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is
through a collective approach to the problems that
confront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in
the United Nations system and elsewhere and build
confidence in our joint ability to work through difficult
times.
I was particularly struck by the comments of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in
his statement on Monday. His characterization of the
8


crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social
or political, but all of these things at once — is exactly
right. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s
conclusion that we must address the crisis on all these
fronts.
As a forum for debate, and as a body capable of
taking global action, the United Nations, together with its
specialized agencies, has an important role to play in
building capacity and providing social support where it is
needed. Much of what the United Nations has achieved
provides the norms and mechanisms to help us through
difficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The
challenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle
the problems that have the potential to undermine our
security, problems that have their greatest impact on
ordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the
time to go backwards.
Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
have underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from
over. The response to terrorism must be decisive and
unequivocal. The international community has a duty to
ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.
Universal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist
instruments must be a fundamental objective of all
Members of this Organization.
War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a
resurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New
Zealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes
Tribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not
enough. New Zealand has long called for an international
criminal court that would have jurisdiction over such
crimes. We commend the effort of those who, through
much hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the
Statute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.
It is our expectation that, with the support of the
international community, the Court will prove an effective
tool in the fight against those who carry out appalling
atrocities.
Nowhere is the need for multilateral action more
clearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental
degradation and promote sustainable development.
New Zealand is honoured to have our own
Environment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair
the Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh
session. It is our strong hope that this session will see us
advance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards
achieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years
ago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of
the Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and
seas and the review of the Barbados Programme of
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States in preparation for next year?s special
session of the General Assembly.
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted last
December was a positive first step in dealing with this
quintessentially global problem. There remain some
important implementation issues to be resolved. The
Fourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will
provide an opportunity to make further progress.
Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,
we now have an Organization that is efficient and
effective. There is more to be done if this great
Organization is to meet the challenges of the present day:
changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from the
administration of the Organization to its front-line work
in development and confronting global problems.
New Zealand looks forward to continuing the
dialogue on financing for development. Through our
current membership of the Economic and Social Council
we have followed closely the evolving debate on this very
important issue. We very much welcome the initiatives
taken by the Organization towards closer linkages with
the Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are
themselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the
present economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge
they have ever had. However, we must decide whether in
their present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first
century.
This Organization, too, like any other, needs to
respond to changing circumstances, and be flexible
enough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world
of today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.
The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need
to address anew the divide between North and South. The
United Nations development role is crucial. Once again I
believe the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head
when he described in his statement on Monday the need
to restore development to its proper place in global
economic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up
trade and investment flows, and promote access to
information and technology. All of these are tools with
which to fight the economic downturn which is
confronting us.

The United Nations clearly has the leading role to play
in development. Other international institutions play a
complementary part. I am personally conscious of the
particular contribution made by the Commonwealth through
the recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That
Mission highlighted the special vulnerability of small
States, which has led to the establishment of the
Commonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which
will have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social
Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.
Within the United Nations we need to correct the
North-South imbalance to which I referred through reform
of the Security Council. More equitable representation on
the Council would better reflect the world as it is and
today?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex
issue, but there has been some good progress this year in
the equally important area of reforming the Council?s
working methods. Altogether, these are matters which
require careful consideration and negotiation. Setting
artificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform
package would not be helpful and could in fact prove
damaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the
support of the greatest possible number of Member States.
I should add that regional groups in the United
Nations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly
open to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to
create a more equitable distribution of electoral
opportunities and to recognize modern-day political and
economic linkages.
In the field of disarmament and arms control, it is
timely to consider how far we have come and what we
have achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end
of nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm
was shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising
grave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken
some encouragement from statements made in this Hall in
recent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which
all countries that have not yet done so will sign up
unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty.
The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to
proceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off
treaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations
concluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping
back from the objective of complete disarmament, including
the elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s
commitment to this objective was reiterated in the
declaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers
of seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand
is now working with those countries on a draft resolution
based on the concerns outlined in the declaration.
One achievement which I personally see as a top
priority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification
protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
Their Destruction. Following a very successful initiative
from Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of
ministers who this week issued a statement urging
Governments to commit themselves to completing this
task.
New Zealand supports the actions of the United
Nations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of
weapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to
the security of the region. We urge the Government of
Iraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission so that the elimination of these
dreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security
Council can once more address the question of lifting
sanctions.
In the 50 years since Member States adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance
of the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time
again. Yet there remains much to be done before the
vision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be
realized for all. We are confident that, under the
leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
we will continue to make good progress towards the
realization of that vision.
The United Nations can add value in promoting and
protecting fundamental human rights standards,
emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have
been supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this
area, and we will continue to do so.
We see countries in all regions of the world seeking
the international community?s support as they build
structures to provide good governance and deliver hope
and greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am
encouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra
Leone in this regard.
As the last 50 years have demonstrated, this
Organization has added a whole new dimension to
10


cooperation among nations. No lesser body could have
achieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it
will be the dramatic development of the international rule
of law and the evolution of collective approaches to
security, both political and economic, which will
characterize our era. In other words, that really is the work
of the United Nations.
Now, with the challenge of the economic problems
that face us, we nations of the world are more dependent
than ever on solving our shared problems together. New
Zealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations
and to the ideals that this Organization stands for.









Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds
of the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on
all of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding
collectively to new challenges and in establishing a
reliable system of international security and stability once
we have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes
accumulated during the century about to end.
This is not only possible, it is the imperative of our
times!
A well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would
live in the world, live in peaceâ€. It contains a highly
philosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will
live in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve
emerging problems through peaceful, political means.
States will live in peace and harmony once they have
recognized their interrelationship and interdependence and
started to seek collective responses to the challenges of
their times.
Experience confirms the truth of this popular
wisdom. The most recent example is the sharp
aggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis
which has besieged many countries, including Russia,
which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The
current upheaval in the world financial markets can be
overcome only by joint efforts that do not pursue
unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global
economic stability. Interaction of States in this process,
including within the framework of the United Nations,
must, on principle, be raised to a new level.
As for Russia, after overcoming an acute political
crisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the
Government and the leading political forces are making
vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial
situation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be
found.
From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not
deviate from the path of reform and will do its best to
pass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to
preserve the democratic progress that has been made but
also to augment it.
Likewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain
consistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards
building a democratic multipolar world, ensuring
interaction with other States in the interests of settling
international problems by political means and developing
broad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.
20


We are convinced that the problems before the world,
no matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the
basis of strict observance of international law and close
interaction among States. Multilateral organizations and
mechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.
Above all, this applies to the United Nations, which
continues to be the sole universal international
peacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than
any other world body to reach agreements on how to settle
conflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying
social and economic causes. It is important for United
Nations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional
organizations.
We highly value the level of interaction that now
exists between the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a
reliable partner in addressing complex European problems,
as well as interaction with the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The
international community has developed a unique arsenal of
political and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of
every international problem. It must be put to effective use.
Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last
resort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of
international law and above all by the United Nations
Charter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of
law rather than the law of force in international affairs.
The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this
year was settled precisely by political means, through the
joint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by
the United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic
evidence that the potential inherent in constructive and
active diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying
exclusively on military force.
A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us
deeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious
consequences for regional and international stability. No
doubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
implement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the
other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the
situation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of
mass destruction and answer the question of whether or not
that country still poses a threat to regional and overall
international security after seven years of work carried out
there by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the
world community is required today to finally unblock this
crisis situation.
Political logic must prevail over the logic of force in
our search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in
Kosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the
Kosovo conflict might lead to a major war with
unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and
Europe at large. It is our firm belief that a political
solution is the only possible way of settling the problem
of Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict
respect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.
The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of
the fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary
gains can be obtained in that country through the use of
arms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for
political solutions, with the United Nations playing a
central role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,
formation of an efficient central Government recognized
by all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs
territorial integrity and independence can realistically be
accomplished.
Collective political efforts are required to give a
second wind to the Middle East peace process. In our
view, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or
proposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has
stymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should
not be ignored that even if the Middle East process has
long-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has
consistently advocated the establishment of an
independent Palestinian State through political means and
negotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable
rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable
assurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be
realized.
In a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results
already achieved.
The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie
case has been a major accomplishment of the international
community. The adoption by the Security Council of a
relevant resolution was possible due to the constructive
approach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United
States, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due
to diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,
which were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed
without delay to its implementation.
21


Arguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the
efforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The
United Nations must play a leading role to this end.
Failure of the international community to fully
extinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in
Africa in recent years is a source of growing concern.
Moreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that
continent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to
achieve full coordination between the United Nations and
Africaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is
why the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on
Africa should focus on shaping a strong common stance
capable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of
Africaâs latest developments.
For objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention
to settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in
Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or
Trans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”
namely, promoting a political settlement and helping build
lasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia
has undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is
doing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can
prove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show
goodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more
meaningful international backing, above all from the United
Nations and the OSCE.
While making strong efforts to settle regional crises,
we should not lose sight of global problems, some of which
have acquired a new dimension in the last year.
We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of
a real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the
international community to encourage all countries to
accede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.
Russia is committed to the idea of continued reduction
of nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic
stability at lower armament levels. In this context, we
attach particularly great importance to the Russian-
American interaction in the area of reducing strategic
offensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,
Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian
Government, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to
seek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II
Treaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to
ratify all documents related to START II.
Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear
arms control process is now on the agenda. We urge
careful consideration of a proposal made by President
Boris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy
nuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of
their national territories. We note with satisfaction the
recent consensus decision in the Conference on
Disarmament to start negotiations banning production of
nuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of
special significance is that the decision was supported by
States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are
convinced that such a ban would be a further necessary
step in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation
regime and nuclear disarmament.
The nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear
terrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed
to be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our
regret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the
international community is required to prevent the real-
life emergence of that new form of terrorism.
Accelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts
of nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it
can be adopted by the General Assembly at the current
session, has become particularly relevant.
Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its
firm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. International terrorism is one of the most
dangerous global challenges to international stability. It
can be successfully combated only through united action
by all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of
making unilateral power moves, shall we be able to
succeed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.
Militant separatism has become another factor that
destabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on
extremist methods in the struggle for the national rights
of minority groups within multinational States, separatism
often finds itself in league with terrorism and religious
fanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal
conflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get
involved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional
crises.
More than two and a half thousand national
minorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of
them to aspire to a State entity of their own, the
disastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be
imagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that
in mind.
22


The fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted
action. We must focus on the practical implementation of
the relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat
adopted by the General Assembly at its special session.
The international community should take a common
stand in implementing the provisions of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary
occurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is
needed in respect of those States which, under various
pretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and
freedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards
involving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level
of Government policy discrimination against a part of the
population. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking
citizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia
and Estonia. The international community, and above all the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
should closely watch the situation in those countries.
I have touched upon a few of the important issues
which the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this
time. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of
joint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal
with urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that
end, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms
and adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the
process of reforming the United Nations, launched by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The
rationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the
Organization.
That is the angle from which we approach the ongoing
discussion on the work of the Security Council. No one
should question the Security Councilâs primary
responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of
peace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its
effectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well
as to build on internal cohesion and work coordination
methods developed in recent years.
I should like to reaffirm that we support the
implementation of reforms and changes in United Nations
mechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the
United Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps
taken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United
Nations auspices, of the Statute of the International
Criminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on
ways to achieve international information security serves
the same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset
threats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science
and technology for purposes incompatible with the
maintenance of international security.
I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of
adapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of
an individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for
example, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in
mind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security
Council, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive
measures. We must not allow a precedent to be created
involving the use of military potential in a crisis situation
without the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is
obvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion
of the existing system of international relations, whose
central element is the United Nations.
United Nations sanctions as an instrument of
international coercion also require a highly balanced
approach. When introduced by the Security Council,
sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that
may be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.
They should not destabilize the economic situation in the
country subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.
It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the
imposition of sanctions and their duration and the
procedures for easing and lifting them.
In short, individual elements of the United Nations
mechanism need improvement and retooling. But we
should go about it with a full sense of responsibility,
mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary
harm is to be avoided at all costs.
Every session of the General Assembly is, in a way,
a milestone event. Each session is expected to make a
tangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems
confronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether
or not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly
lives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It
will depend on all of us whether or not joint effective
steps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful
world, a world free from war and conflict and from
financial and economic upheaval, a world built on the
principles of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands
ready to work with others to attain these goals.






Let me begin by thanking the
Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by
noting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.
Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United
Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode
into war, all around the world. And today more people
determine their own destiny than at any previous moment
in history.
We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more
widely embraced than ever before. On every continent
people are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and
a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United
Nations.
Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise
of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil
today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets
and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from
this economy have a special responsibility to do more to
minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global
markets to all citizens. And the United States is
determined to do that.
We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious
and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many
States to acquire such weapons.
And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not
fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a
continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which says
9


“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
person.”
Here at the United Nations, at international summits
around the world and on many occasions in the United
States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in
detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing
and what we must yet do to combat terror.
Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why
all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of
our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern
to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted
over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi
Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own
citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public
buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives
to building bridges between nations — people very much
like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred
against the United States.
Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with
a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in
promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We
love our country for its dedication to political and religious
freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights
of the individual. But we know that many people see us as
a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they
find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots
elsewhere.
But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we
believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue
our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us
to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our
backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own
opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace
a victory they must never have.
Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as
only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a
clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and
innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the
people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the
people of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American
killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500
more injured — innocent people going about their business
on a busy morning.
Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where
the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants
alike — mostly children and women, two of them
pregnant — people out shopping together when their
future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the
past.
Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin
gas in the Tokyo subway.
Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car
bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos
Aires.
Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by
ancient animosities that cry out for resolution.
Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year
after year, for all their progress towards peace.
Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of
unfathomable terror with still no end in sight.
Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second
President to assassination.
Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,
Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where
innocent people have been victimized by terror.
None of those victims were American. But every
one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or
mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s
hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never
be the same.
Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,
of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the
number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,
sometimes less than the number of people killed by
lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point
in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the
1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater
openness and the explosion of information and weapons
technology. The new technologies of terror and their
increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility
of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to
chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing
each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a
threat to all humankind.
Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is
an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to
measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb
10


threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;
the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so
hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or
child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the
rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so
crucial to peace and prosperity.
In every corner of the world, with the active support
of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build
better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with
their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from
around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in
Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday
Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that
cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure
each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But
what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle
East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements
have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many
businesses will never be created in places crying out for
investments of time and money? How many talented young
people in countries represented here have turned their backs
on public service? The question is not only how many lives
have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were
lost in their aftermath.
There is no justification for killing innocents.
Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and
righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to
understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of
course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen
that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate
act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing
came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the
Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards
peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this
stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,
after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and
thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their
own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases
terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.
We must also acknowledge that there are economic
sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses
of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the
siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing
social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor
can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents
is not a social programme.
Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does
not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that
foster it. The most recent United Nations Human
Development Report suggests the gulf is widening
between the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work
harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into
the poison of hatred.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only
revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must
show people they have everything to gain by embracing
cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply
an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s
responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to
spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to
build new, open economies. Developed nations have an
obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of
prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week
ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international
economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens
within them.
Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line
centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of
civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate
in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an
inevitable clash between Western civilization and values
and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is
terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any
religion to justify whatever political objectives they
have — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the
world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,
grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding
of Islam.
A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from
Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United
States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.
There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the
United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The
6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there
is no inherent clash between Islam and America.
Americans respect and honour Islam.
As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and
around the world, I see again that we share the same
hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to
provide for our children, to follow the faith of our
choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and
to pass on brighter possibilities to our children.
Of course, we are not identical. There are important
differences that cross race and culture and religion which
demand understanding and deserve respect. But every
11


river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in
America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all
Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our
increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of
friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will
continue to look for common values, common interests and
common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit
expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for
prayers by people assembled together are twice those for
prayers said at home.”
When it comes to terrorism, there should be no
dividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and
Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and
emerging countries. The only dividing line is between those
who practise, support or tolerate terror and those who
understand that it is murder, plain and simple.
If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and
should be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are
the concrete steps we can take together to protect our
common destiny? What are our common obligations? At
least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,
no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on
States that do; to act together to step up extradition and
prosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to
strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce
the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger
domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of
explosives; to raise international standards for airport
security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and
despair.
We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and
law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist
networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of
those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our
embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I
will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to
repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the
worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in
Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.
But no matter how much each of us does alone, our
progress will be limited without our common efforts.
We will also do our part to address the sources of
despair and alienation through the Agency for International
Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in
Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue
our strong support for the United Nations Development
Programme, the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United
Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World
Food Programme. We also recognize the critical role
these agencies play and the importance of all countries,
including the United States, in paying their fair share.
In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new
terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or
political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as
a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of
the future, between those who tear down and those who
build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and
community.
The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be
strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning
to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important
that we do this together.
Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the
Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many
speeches in support of the United Nations when it was
just beginning,
“All agreements and all peace are built on
confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot
get on with other people in the world unless you
have confidence in them.”
It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s
problems to have confidence in one another. It is not
necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have
confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that
we understand every single difference among us to have
confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we
affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together
we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a
throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can
meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears
with confidence.









Mr. President, may I take this
opportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa
and as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to
extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election
to the high post of President of the General Assembly.
You will be presiding over this august Assembly of
the nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and
decisions will be of the greatest consequence to the
continuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global
peace and prosperity.
The Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own
country, which is a proud member of that Movement,
invests great trust in this Organization to discharge its
responsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical
period of its existence.
Quite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly will be remembered through the ages as
the moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the
Nazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration
held high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be
built on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in
each of its clauses.
For those who had to fight for their emancipation,
those such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had
to free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights served as the
vindication of the justice of our cause.
At the same time, it constituted a challenge to us
that our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to
the implementation of the perspectives contained in the
Declaration.
Today we celebrate the fact that this historic
document has survived a turbulent five decades, which
have seen some of the most extraordinary developments
in the evolution of human society.
These include the collapse of the colonial system,
the passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in
science and technology and the achievement of the
complex process of globalization.
And yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who
are the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent
conflicts.
They have, as yet, not attained their freedom from
fear of death that would be brought about by the use of
weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional
arms.
Many are still unable to exercise the fundamental
and inalienable democratic rights that would enable them
to participate in the determination of the destiny of their
countries, nations, families and children and to protect
themselves from tyranny and dictatorship.
The very right to be human is denied every day to
hundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and
the unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs,
water and shelter, education, health care and a healthy
environment.
The failure to achieve the vision contained in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic
expression in the contrast between wealth and poverty
which characterizes the divide between the countries of
the North and the countries of the South and within
individual countries in all hemispheres.
It is made especially poignant and challenging by the
fact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the
perpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State
and intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the
democratic right of many across the world, all result from
acts of commission and omission, particularly by those
who occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the
economy, and in other spheres of human activity.
13


What I am trying to say is that all these social ills,
which constitute an offence against the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result
of the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the
deities.
They are the consequence of decisions which men and
women take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom
will not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the
vision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
This Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely
because the founders of this Organization and the nations
of the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of
fascism, including many that still had to achieve their own
emancipation, understood clearly that our human world was
an interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of
happiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity
have a universal application, because each people and every
individual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly
say it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where
others, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted
with misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation.
Thus can we say that the challenge posed by the next
50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
by the next century whose character it must help to fashion,
consists in whether humanity, and especially those who will
occupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to
ensure that at last we build a human world consistent with
the provisions of that historic Declaration and other human
rights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.
Immediately, a whole range of areas of conflict
confronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are
familiar with these, which range from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own
continent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan,
Tajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.
Clearly, this Organization, and especially the Security
Council, acting together with people of goodwill in the
countries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act
decisively to contribute to the termination of these
destructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to
defeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of
arms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice
can be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes
are necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.
As Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General
for the contribution he has made to help us find the way
towards ending violent strife on our continent. We have
taken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts
to banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the
report from page to page, but I will try to do so.
The very first resolution of the General Assembly,
adopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge
of
“the elimination from national armaments of atomic
weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable
to mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c))
We must face the fact that after countless initiatives
and resolutions, we still do not have concrete and
generally accepted proposals supported by a clear
commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy,
final and total elimination of nuclear weapons and
nuclear-weapon capabilities.
We take this opportunity to salute our sister
Republic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge
all others that have not yet done so to follow this
excellent example.
In an honest attempt to contribute to the definition
of the systematic and progressive steps required to
eliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation
which they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil,
Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and
Sweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First
Committee for consideration by the Assembly. It is
appropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free
world: the need for a new agenda”.
I call with all humility on all Members of the United
Nations seriously to consider this important draft
resolution and to give it their support. We must ask the
question, which might sound naive to those who have
elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal
to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass
destruction — why do they need them, anyway?
In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to
explain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the
consequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the
use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of
some States over others.
14


Urgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and
permanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the
realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of
Palestine and respect for the independence and security of
all the States of this important region. We also look
forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of
Western Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is
possible to take these matters off the world agenda on the
basis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples
concerned.
Similarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken
by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this
supremely important country of Africa, to enable it to
return to democratic rule and a system of governance
directed at serving the interests of all its people.
Together we are also faced with the scourges of drug
abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized
transnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly
support the measures adopted or being discussed by the
United Nations to deal with these challenges and commit
our country and Government to cooperate fully in all
regional and international initiatives to ensure that the
peoples of the world, including our own, are spared the
destructive impact of these crimes.
The world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as
President Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has
plunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and
disoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep
personal disappointment to tens of millions of people
around the world.
President Clinton also said:
“Recent press reports have described an entire
generation working its way into the middle class for
over 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty
within a matter of months. The stories are
heartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live in
the lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families
who owned their own homes, sent their children to
college, travelled abroad, now living by selling their
possessions.”
President Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” in
the world economy
“have brought or aggravated problems in Russia and
Asia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin
America to South Africa”,
and he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic
theory.
He further recognized that with a quarter of the
world’s population in declining growth, the United States,
in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’s
words,
“ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growth
at home depends upon growth abroad”.
I have quoted the President of the United States at
such length both because he is correct and because he is
the leader of the most powerful country in the world.
Accordingly, we would like to believe that with the
problem facing all humanity, and especially the poor,
having thus been recognized, courage will not desert the
powerful when it comes to determining the correct course
to be taken, and following this course, addressing the
challenge that has been identified.
The tragedy President Clinton describes goes far
beyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to
which he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the
condition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of
ordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of
poverty around the globe has been brought into sharp
focus by the destructive fast movements of currents of
wealth from one part of the world to another.
Put starkly, we have a situation in which the further
accumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the
improvement of the quality of life of all humanity, is
generating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.
The imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death
matter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to
ensure that the countries of the South gain access to the
productive resources that have accumulated within the
world economy should not be avoided by seeking to
apportion as much blame as possible to the poor.
Clearly, all relevant matters will have to be
addressed, including such issues as greater inflows of
long-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;
technology transfers; human resource development; the
emancipation of women and the development of the
young; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS
epidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening
of financial and other institutions relevant to sustained
economic growth and development.
15


Fortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work
will also have to be done to restructure the multilateral
financial and economic institutions so that they address the
problems of the modern world economy and become
responsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.
Similarly, this very Organization, including its
important Security Council, must itself go through its own
process of reformation so that it serves the interests of the
peoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for
which it was established.
The issues we have mentioned were discussed in a
comprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference
of the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban,
South Africa, earlier this month.
I am privileged to commend the decisions of that
important meeting to the General Assembly and the United
Nations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration,
which the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that
the decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will
greatly assist this Organization in its work and further
enhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the
solution of the problems that face the nations of the world,
both rich and poor.
This is probably the last time I will have the honour
to stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.
Born as the First World War came to a close, and departing
from public life as the world marks half a century of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that
part of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it
should be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and
tranquillity in the village of my birth.
As I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as
its hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has
emerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region,
on my continent and in the world, which will not allow that
any should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any
should be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should
be condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should
be stripped of their human dignity, as we were.
I will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance will
strike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the
changing seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a
realizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of
the aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity.
Then would history and the billions throughout the world
proclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we
toiled to give life to a workable dream.














I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on his
assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at
its current session. I believe that his wisdom and
experience will enable him to accomplish his important
mission with distinction.
I would also like to express my appreciation for the
contribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of the
General Assembly during the previous session.
At present, the international situation is undergoing
profound changes. The accelerated trend towards
multipolarity has injected new vitality into international
relations. Economic globalization is developing very
quickly, and countries are becoming increasingly
interdependent. The development of multipolarity and
globalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustment
of international relations.

Bilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-
confrontation, non-alignment and non-targeting against
third countries, have been established one after another.
Various regional and intercontinental organizations of
cooperation have become more active than ever before.
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,
pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute
to peace and development as well as to the establishment
of a fair and equitable new international political and
economic order.
10


However, we cannot lose sight of the many
uncertainties still existing in the world.
The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In
the post-cold-war period of today, the people of all
countries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.
It is to be regretted that last May India conducted
nuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus
adversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.
Soon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear
tests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the
tension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy
blow to international nuclear disarmament and the
mechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This
has aroused the great concern of the international
community. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully
implement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, as well as the provisions
of Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their
plans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and
unconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and
Pakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir
through peaceful means.
In our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,
the international community faces the pressing task of
consolidating and strengthening the international non-
proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of
nuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority
of the NPT.
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,
the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly
that a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons
should be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the
Chinese Government has on many occasions called on all
the other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and
nuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a
convention on no first use of nuclear weapons through
negotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a
fissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the
negotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign
the Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the
Chinese Government that China will abide by the
provisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming
nuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies
of unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and
unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will
continue to support the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory
and verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis
of the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the
largest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear
disarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its
responsibility.
The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July
1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of
many countries of the region. Its negative impact is still
spreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen
since last June has added to the difficulty of economic
recovery in the region.
The crisis occurred in the overall context of
economic globalization, and its impact is being felt across
the world. Stepping up international cooperation and
putting an early end to this crisis is not only in the
immediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also
in the interests of the international community as a whole,
and especially of the developed countries. We hope that
those developed countries with important influence on the
region’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities and
take active, resolute and effective measures to make their
due contributions to safeguarding the stability of the
financial order and promoting the recovery and
development of the region’s economy.
Following the eruption of the East Asian financial
crisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly
responsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the
countries concerned within the framework arranged by
International Monetary Fund and, at the same time,
through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall
interests of maintaining the stability and development of
the region, China has made the decision not to devalue
the yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great
pressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the
growing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to
maintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain
unchanged.
Fighting with one heart and one mind, we won the
battle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a
series of measures to deepen our reform and expand
11


domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of
our economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise
in this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believe
that with the common efforts of the countries in the region
and of the rest of the international community, the East
Asian economy will be able to gradually get out of its
predicament and return to the road of sound development.
The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate
for some time, which has aroused widespread concern in
the international community. We are of the view that the
Arab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic
negotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental
interests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive
to world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties
concerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible
and pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the
peace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and
on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and
the agreements already reached. The Chinese Government
will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and
the efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant
parties to this end.
We are following the developments in the Kosovo
region of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the
parties involved will solve the problem through political
dialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the
Balkans have been hard won and should be cherished all
the more by the relevant parties and by the international
community.
The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are
another source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will
be appropriately resolved by the parties involved through
peaceful means.
The twenty-first century is greeting us. On the
threshold of the new century, the United Nations bears
heavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world
peace, promoting human progress and establishing a just
and rational new international political and economic order.
It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end
of the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints
and more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented
opportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and
can use its own advantages to play a unique and
constructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable
world, in establishing a new type of international
relationship based on friendship and cooperation and in
taking up the common challenges facing mankind.
China has consistently held that it is necessary to
carry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that
the Organization can better keep abreast of the changing
situation and serve its numerous Member States. We have
taken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform
in a number of fields promoted by all Member States.
Some reform measures and recommendations proposed by
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been
approved by the General Assembly and are now being put
into practice. Intense discussions on reform of the
Security Council are also in orderly progress. At present,
there are still differences among Member States on quite
a few issues involved in the reform of the Security
Council. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive
approach and play an active part in the relevant
consultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement
of relevant issues.
Here, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the
Chinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of
the Security Council bears on the interests of all countries
and so requires a democratic style of work and extensive
and full consultations. All Member States should have an
equal right to speak on the question of the reform, and
their reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.
Secondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich
countries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet
the concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more
attention should be given to the interests and aspirations
of the vast number of developing countries.
Representation should be balanced between the developed
and the developing countries.
Thirdly, the reform measures are of major
significance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the
Security Council in maintaining international peace and
security. They should be worked out on the basis of the
realities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course
that the objective of the reform of the Security Council is
to solve problems rather than to create new sources of
discord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security
Council gains extensive support from Member States, it
is essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously
promoted the advancement and development of the cause
12


of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in
Asia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from
colonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark
system of apartheid, won basic political rights and became
an equal member of the international community. The
United Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international
instruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the
Right to Development, further enriching the content of
human rights. The right to development has been
universally recognized in the international community as an
inseparable part of basic human rights.
In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken
place in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the
introduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed
an ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved
legal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the
rights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese
people now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality
than ever before and a much fuller and more settled life
than in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to
make unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to
strengthen the legal system, while developing the economy
so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to
the full.
The Chinese Government is active in supporting and
participating in the activities of the United Nations in the
field of human rights. China has all along stood for
international cooperation in the field of human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance
understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground
and strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese
Government is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and
cooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,
with human rights organizations at the national and
international levels.
Last October, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese
Government has decided to sign it early next month. This
once again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese
Government with respect to promoting and protecting
human rights. China is ready to continue to work with other
countries to maintain and increase the current positive
momentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote
the furtherance of the world cause of human rights.
This year is the twentieth anniversary of the
introduction of the policy of reform and opening up in
China. In these two decades, China has scored
tremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and
modernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our
national economy has gained a favourable momentum of
high growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened
reforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last
September, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth
National Congress, formulated a blueprint for China’s
cross-century development based on the new
developments both on the domestic and international
scene. In March this year, our new State institutions and
new Government were formed through elections at the
first session of the ninth National People’s Congress of
China. We will build energetically on our political and
economic restructuring and carry forward the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
twenty-first century in a comprehensive way.
China’s modernization drive requires a stable
international environment of peace. China will continue to
pursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This
policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in
independence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard
world peace, and to seek common development.
To persist in independence and maintain the
initiative, we always put our State sovereignty and
national security first and never develop relations with
other countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacred
territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the
upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide
useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,
adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and
one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang
Zemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait
relations and promoting the process of peaceful
reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and
resolutely oppose the creation of the “independence of
Taiwan”, “two Chinas” and “one China/one, Taiwan” and
Taiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.
We respect the sovereignty of other countries and
vigorously support the efforts of all countries in the
world, and of developing countries in particular, to defend
their State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our
own. In handling international relations, we adhere to
non-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of
Third States. We do not go in for military blocs and the
13


arms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China’s
development will not pose a threat to any other country.
The so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded and
fabricated with ulterior motives.
To safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for
the maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is
our consistent view that State-to-State relations should be
handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful
coexistence, transcending differences in social systems and
ideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests
and, at the same time, respect those of others and
continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by
seeking the convergent points of common interests. With
regard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary
to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and
strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by
resorting to force or the threat of force.
It is essential to completely reject the mentality of the
cold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve
international and regional security issues through consensus
and participation on an equal footing. We in China stand
for the equality of all countries, big or small, and for
accelerated democratization of international relations. World
affairs should be handled through consultation by all
countries, and no country should impose its own will on
others.
To seek common development, peace is the
prerequisite of development and development is the basis of
peace. In today’s world, where the economy is increasingly
globalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order
to achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside
world is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As a
huge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of
the trend of economic globalization and be even more
active in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop
trade and expand scientific and technological exchanges
with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches
importance to and actively participates in the activities of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)
and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the
establishment and development of friendly exchanges and
cooperation with other global and intercontinental or
regional organizations for economic cooperation.
China continues to take a positive attitude towards
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to
unremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified
for entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations
have dragged on and on with no decision having been
made. China is a developing country, and we can
negotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis,
in accordance with the principle of balancing rights and
obligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned
will take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up
excessive demands and work for an early conclusion of
the relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO will
benefit all its members and make the multilateral trade
mechanism complete and more balanced.
Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to
use the forum of the United Nations to brief you on
China’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing
to such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,
catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,
Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the
submerged regions, the duration of the floods and the
seriousness of the disaster they caused were something
rarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of
people’s lives and their safety, the Chinese Government
mobilized forces from all sectors across the country and
organized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out
battle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the
assaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the
safety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and
major cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of
life and property was kept to a minimum.
At present, the Chinese Government is sparing no
effort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has
started reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We
are taking every measure possible, with full confidence,
to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread
epidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and
that none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas
will drop out from school or be deprived of education. In
the course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the
great flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to
push forward our reform and opening up and the socialist
modernization drive.
Since China was hit by the disastrous floods, a
number of countries and international organizations and
communities have sent messages to express sympathy and
solicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.
I wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people, our most sincere
gratitude to them.
The world of today is a world of interdependence.
The promotion of peace, cooperation and development has
14


become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and
work together to bring into the twenty-first century a world
of peace, security and stability in the interest of
development.











I congratulate
you, Mr. President, on your election. I wish you good
fortune and all of us a successful session.
I should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko for
the dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-
second session. He advanced the reform process at the
United Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and must
follow up these efforts.
This session of the General Assembly has a special
significance for my country. It was 25 years ago, almost to
the day, on 19 September 1973, that Walter Scheel became
the first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of
Germany to address the United Nations. When he described
our perception of the United Nations, he said that it meant
more than the mere security of States, more than the mere
regulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that what
it is all about is the beginning and the objective of any
rational policy â€” people.
That description of our role in the United Nations
remains valid. United Germany too feels committed to a
world free from fear and want, protected by the rule of law,
a world in which every individual has his opportunity and
which preserves the integrity of Creation for future
generations. It is the vision enshrined in the International
Bill of Human Rights.
We have come a lot closer to that vision over the past
25 years. The division of Germany, Europe and the world
has been healed. The world is developing ever more into
the â€œone worldâ€ on the foundations of democracy and
human rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear that
the human race has never been so bound up together in its
common destiny, united by common challenges, as it is
today.
The crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the world
economy. The global scourges of drugs, organized crime
and terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. The
year 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds of
Bangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods in
China have claimed thousands of lives.
No State, whether super-Power or small island State,
can master these global challenges alone. And no one can
escape them, least of all the suffering people: the
homeless in Bangladesh, the drug addict in Europe, the
victim of civil war in Africa.
We can shape our future only through joint efforts.
We therefore need global action and global management
for the global challenges of the twenty-first century; not
tomorrow or the day after, but today.
This is a test not only for Governments but also for
the other global players: the non-governmental
organizations and the multinational corporations. Never
were the non-governmental organizations so important as
they are today. Without them the Ottawa Convention
banning landmines could not have been signed in
December 1997. And, let us not forget, 51 of the worldâs
hundred largest economic entities are now companies, and
only 49 of them States. All this shows that the time has
come for new alliances for peace, freedom and prosperity
throughout the world.
The age of globalization is the age of the United
Nations. Only here do all nations of the world come
together. Only here can we find joint solutions to the
global challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why we
Germans want to help get the United Nations in shape for
the twenty-first century. We are facing up to this
responsibility â€” as the second largest export nation and
the third largest economy in the world, and as the country
with the largest population in the European Union.
We owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitude
and support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to the
Member States. The Security Council still mirrors the
world as it was at the end of the Second World War, but
not the enhanced status of Asia, Africa and Latin America
with the Caribbean.
The same is true of the greater weight of Japan and
united Germany. I wish to thank all Member States that
advocate a permanent seat for Germany on the Security
Council. Security Council reform cannot be delayed any
longer; otherwise, the momentum will be lost and that
would be bad indeed.
16


Since the ending of the cold war the United Nations
has had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It therefore
needs effective institutions, and for this reason it has a right
to expect members to pay their dues on time. All, and
especially the big members, must help according to their
ability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplish
its tasks. Germany, the third largest contributor, will
continue to meet its obligations.
We know from recent experience that we should not
add to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.
This is a task especially for regional organizations like the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). If
they succeed in settling conflicts locally, the Security
Council will not need to deal with them. I think that would
be very well-advised, because it would free capacities for
all of us.
New avenues of joint action are therefore called for.
To pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.
Only those who face up to the challenge can exploit the
opportunities and cushion the risks.
The impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows that
the world economy needs a reliable framework. That is not
to say we need a global financial authority or fixed
exchange rates, least of all a new wave of protectionism.
But we do need better early-warning mechanisms, more
transparency and more efficient banking systems, especially
in the newly emerging economies.
This is not a task for Governments alone. What is
needed now is a global public-private partnership between
Governments, international financial organizations and
corporations. We therefore support the American initiative
for a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emerging
economies on a new international financial architecture. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
should not always have to serve as the stopgap when the
opportunity for structural reforms has been missed.
Managing globalization also means weaving a network
of partnerships between the big regional groupings and the
big countries. The regional groupings are the components
of a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.
The European Unionâs partnerships with regional
organizations like the Association of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN), the Southern Common Market
(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) prove we are on the right course: We
want an open, not a confrontational, kind of regionalism.
I am confident that the European Union will be an
anchor of stability in the twenty-first century. By
introducing a single currency on 1 January 1999, it is
focusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It is
about to begin further negotiations on accession with
associated partners. What Willy Brandt said about
Germany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:
â€œWhat belongs together is now growing togetherâ€.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) too
is also gradually opening its doors to the new
democracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it will
admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Together
with Russia, Ukraine and the other Commonwealth of
Independent States members, we are developing a
comprehensive security partnership.
True, the Russians are having a rough time at
present, but the world needs a democratic and stable
Russia, a Russia which will play the role commensurate
with its size, its status and its potential. Russia faces a
Herculean task of consolidating the economy and
maintaining social stability. All those responsible must
face up to the challenge: the President, the Government,
the parties and business. Of course, the regions too are
called upon.
I know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakov
last week in Moscow that Russia intends neither to
change course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russia
affects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can count
on us.
The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâs
side. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of the
word is looming. The situation of the refugees, more than
250,000 of them, is desperate. International organizations,
the European Union, the United States and Russia are
coordinating their efforts to enable those who have been
driven out to return to their villages.
Time is getting short; winter is just around the
corner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies with
Belgrade, with President Milosevic. He must realize that
the international community will react with military force
if necessary. We still seek a political solution for
Kosovo â€” self-administration within the Yugoslav
Federation. However, this cannot be achieved without
Belgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now be
silenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslav
security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The
recent reports we have received from Kosovo are very
17


disappointing, troubling and worrisome. I hope they are not
true.
NATO is prepared to provide the backing for a
political solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part of
Europe. Their future can only be a European one. The
history of Europe in this century shows that we can
overcome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have the
willingness to do so.
In Bosnia, too, we have seen animosity slowly being
replaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid my
twelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowly
beginning to blossom again, and the countryâs
reconstruction is progressing.
Nonetheless, the peace process must continue to be
buttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR),
for the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of the
result of the elections, the international community will not
tolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peace
agreement. Furthermore, genuine peace will not return until
the presumed war criminals and enemies of peace â€”
Mr. Karadzic and his lot â€” have been brought to trial in
The Hague.
Only when those guilty of crimes against humanity,
torturers and terrorists all over the world, have been
brought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.
Thus, the establishment of the International Criminal
Court on 17 July as a major step towards a world order in
which the force of law, not the law of force, prevails.
Germany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries to
sign and ratify the Courtâs Statute.
No one stands more at the mercy of those who wield
power than refugees. At present more than 20 million
people worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people,
women, children; people who are sick, homeless and
destitute and have absolutely no idea what is going to
happen to them.
Over the last several years I have been to many
refugee camps, in Albania, Africa and the Middle East.
Every refugeeâs case is a story of immeasurable human
suffering.
Germany is now the country with the second largest
number of refugees. From Kosovo alone, 150,000 refugees
have found refuge in Germany.
The suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian and
political challenge to the international community as a
whole. What is now needed, therefore, is a global refugee
policy. The United Nations, too, has to do something
about it.
Specifically, this means, first, a more equitable
distribution of the refugees, as I recommended here in the
General Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorest
countries to their own devices in trying to cope with the
refugee problem.
Secondly, greater efforts will have to be made to
remove the causes of flight and expulsion.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has declared the
twenty-first century a century of prevention, and with
good reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad that
people have to take flight is to make oneself partly
responsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.
This is the task of preventive diplomacy, of human rights
observers and peacekeeping forces.
Striking at the root of mass flight and migration also
means eliminating the economic, ecological and social
causes. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. The
wealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume
86 per cent of all goods, the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3
per cent.
This equity gap must be closed. Every individual has
a right to live in dignity, free from hunger and want.
All nations must be given a fair chance in global
competition, the poorest ones in particular. Hence, it is up
to the rich countries to help the poor make the most of
their opportunities for development.
Our aim is a social world market economy. This is
why in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche marks
on bilateral and multilateral assistance measures â€” an
investment in peace and stability.
Africa shows what can be achieved when the
international community and the countries concerned pull
together. Today, democratic elections are held in more
than half of the African countries. In 20 African countries
economic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent, and in 11
it is higher still.
We want the Africans to know that we will not
abandon that vast continent and its 800 million people,
despite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.
18


Poverty and refugee problems are also exacerbating
the situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and in
the Palestinian territories long for peace more than anything
else on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.
The Israelis and Palestinians must move towards each
other again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.
We Europeans will continue to support this process
with our American friends. We back Israelâs legitimate
claim to security for its State and citizens.
The Palestinians have recognized that claim; now
words must be followed by deeds. They must see to it that
terrorism has no chance.
But Israel, too, must show compromise as regards a
further partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any new
obstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowing
new settlements in the occupied territories.
Particularly in the Middle East, we have time and
again seen that terrorism leads to a dead end, destruction
and suffering. We must pit all our strength against the
cynics who advocate violence, the fanatics and ideologues;
the dead of Omagh, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as a
warning. Those who plant bombs and murder people must
be brought to justice.
Drying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty, ethnic
conflict and fundamentalism â€” is our common
responsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.
Islam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could be
further from the truth than the clichÃ© that Islam is
synonymous with fundamentalism and violations of human
rights.
We want a dialogue of cultures and religions,
especially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanity
that unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienable
dignity of every individual, as expressed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the human rights
covenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarks
for our joint action in the twenty-first century.
Violations of human rights are no longer an internal
matter of States. They concern us all. Any group which,
like the regime in Kabul, denies women their basic human
rights places itself outside the international community of
common values.
The world of tomorrow will be judged by how we
treat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.
Yet the rights of many children are still being trampled
underfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live a
life in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.
Particularly appalling is the fact that every year
some two million children all over the world are sexually
abused. Only through joint action can we stop child
prostitution, traffic in children and child pornography,
including that proliferated via the Internet. I therefore
propose that the United Nations set up a contact point to
coordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse of
children. The optional protocol to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child designed to afford better protection
against sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted and
quickly put into effect.
Children are small people who need big rights.
Protection for children during armed conflicts must be
improved, including by outlawing their use as soldiers.
We all hoped that with the ending of the East-West
confrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration would
be gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. The
threat of proliferation of means of mass destruction
hovers over the human race. We can safeguard world
peace in the twenty-first century only if we keep such
terrible weapons under control.
In Geneva, India and Pakistan have agreed to
negotiations on a cut-off. Thatâs a good sign, but not
nearly enough. It must be followed by their accession to
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And all
nations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. This also applies to the conventions banning
chemical and biological weapons. The adoption of a
verification protocol to the Biological Weapons
Convention is now urgent.
Next March the Ottawa Convention imposing a
worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters into
force â€” a great success. Only if all countries now sign
the Convention will these diabolical devices soon be
wiped from the face of the earth. It is our common task
to get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining, using
state-of-the-art technology.
We must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.
The victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are a
warning. We must swing the wheel round now. This we
owe to our children and grandchildren. We can save our
blue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.
19


Take the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launched
a global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.
But time is getting short. We have just had the warmest
half year this century. At the fourth session of the
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for Buenos Aires
in November, we shall have to agree on the instruments
with which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.
Take water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is more
important than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is in
short supply. Two billion people have insufficient access or
none at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutions
for the peaceful use and conservation of water, the source
of life, is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.
The pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowed
to spark fresh conflicts.
Germany intends to remain in the vanguard of the
international campaign to protect the environment. I am
gratified to note that our commitment has been
acknowledged by the appointment of Klaus TÃ¶pfer as
Executive Director of the United Nations Environment
Programme.
But we are not going to rest on our laurels. A few
days ago I opened an international conference in Potsdam
on early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. The
conference has shown that progress can be achieved if we
want it. Specifically, it is now a question of establishing
effective global early-warning systems for environmental
crises and natural disasters, and developing emergency
management arrangements for the coordination of
international relief measures. We must now get down to
this task, and the United Nations is the right place to do so.
Four hundred and sixty three days from now the
twentieth century comes to an end â€” a century of
unprecedented violence and destruction. The coming
century must be a century with a humane countenance.
What a wonderful vision. But talking about it is not
enough. Only if we act together will we survive together.
The United Nations is indispensable to this task.
Strengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitable
world â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to coming
generations. My country will devote every possible effort
to this task.








Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,
on your election, which attests to the high regard in which
the international community holds you and your country,
and which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,
welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session
of the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead
to the strengthening of the Organization.
It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, “the
peoples of the United Nations”, decided to join our efforts
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person...to
establish conditions under which justice...can be
maintained, and to promote social progress”.
That immense ambition was justified by the recent
horrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from
happening again — a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a
superhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert
Camus put it:
”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time
to accomplish, that’s all.”
A long time has elapsed, and we are still working on
that, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what
we have done as the United Nations throughout these 53
years, of what the Security Council and successive General
Assemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-
General — in particular the current one over the last two
years, whose work has been so outstanding.
Over the decades, the Security Council, except when
paralysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed
to shoulder its primary responsibility for international
security. When it failed to do so, no other institution was
able to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50
years ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations
of this kind.
The institutional framework established by the
Charter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from
cold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,
proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne
out in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when
the Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in
Africa, during the creation of the United Nations Mission
in the Central African Republic, which was the first
entirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and
even in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted
to the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its
objective.
And yet, as the Secretary-General himself
emphasized recently,
“Unpredictability and surprise have become almost
commonplace” (A/53/1, para. 1),
and the illusions of the end of the cold war have not
stood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge
this fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.
Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some
States take advantage of circumstances and deliberately
carry out archaic policies of force that contravene the
principles of the Charter. On other occasions, the
abdication or implosion of States has released among
various groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very
much alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these
are destabilizing factors which, while very different, all
help to disorganize and imperil international relations.
Several major crises have proved this recently. The
Asian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,
when badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world
that is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive
reactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid
spread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is
exchanged on the financial markets — huge sums of
money that are greater than the means of intervention of
all the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those
amounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.
Today, they are 15 times greater.
The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic
reminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute
combined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity
could open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.
In East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of
a border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven
States are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory
15


of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization
is threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I
cannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,
civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve
more than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.
Twenty-two million civilians — displaced persons and
returnees — have been affected by these conflicts and
require assistance from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active
in 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;
slavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;
disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.
But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of
woe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which
is the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very
moment trying to maintain peace on four continents with
approximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17
operations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20
agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.
Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in
1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.
I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the
multilateral system do not today have the necessary means
to meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not
give up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our
action?
Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,
we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our
institutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security
Council a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the
case of “threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and
acts of aggression”.
Nothing can justify the use of force by a State, a
group of States or an organization, however powerful, if
prior authorization was not received from the Security
Council — except in cases of self-defence.
My country shares the impatience of those who
deplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution
to various cruel conflicts — for example, in Kosovo, where
the humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November
1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put
forward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its
other partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground
for a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for
the return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible
use of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to
forgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after
this case there would be another exception, and then
another. Little by little, any country would declare itself
entitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or
ambitions so required, and we would have to begin all
over again. We must remain firm on this principle.
Second, we must make sure that the authority of the
Security Council is respected and its resolutions are
complied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today
the question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.
The lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council’s
resolutions, been made subject to the controlled
dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must
therefore meet these conditions — completely meet them,
but only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim
must be to reintegrate Iraq into the international
community, starting with the region.
The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’s
complete compliance with the relevant resolutions — all
the resolutions, nothing but the resolutions — which
means Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the United
Nations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’s
disarmament.
The third need is to increase the representativeness
of the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.
This is why my country has come out in favour of
enlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,
new permanent members — two seats for the North, to
which Germany and Japan have every claim, and three
for the South; on the other hand, there should be new
non-permanent members for the North and South. This
enlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’s
effectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its
responsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third
session of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.
Fourth, we must increase the capacity of our
Organization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is
much to be done. Now that the international community
has just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the
peace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in
Madrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,
and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France
continues to support the persevering efforts of the United
States Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left
without any prospects at all should those efforts
unfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac
and President Mubarak have proposed in that event
convening a conference of countries resolved to save the
16


peace. This concern for the future has been very well
received. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working
to further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of
meeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a
just and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and
agreements that have been reached.
Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As I
mentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo six or seven African States of the
Great Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle
of problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,
ethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so
forth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each
of these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a
regional solution. That is why my country has raised again
the idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes
region, which we suggested as early as 1995. The
conference would be placed under the aegis of the United
Nations or the Organization of African Unity, with the
active participation of the States of the region. Several
African diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We
support those efforts.
Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us
pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’s
representatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of
Matre Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.
Fifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral
disarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the
nuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone
recognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime
and pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear,
conventional, chemical and biological.
Our primary objective here should be the entry into
force as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United
Kingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the
Treaty and is the only one to have completed the
dismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that
have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — including
India and Pakistan, which have announced their intention
not to carry out any more nuclear tests.
Another objective here would be a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for military purposes. I
proposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of
the Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we
should launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-
discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give
new impetus to disarmament.
We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of
chemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the
Convention banning chemical weapons becomes universal
and that the Convention banning biological weapons is
made truly effective through a verification mechanism.
Combating the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles
capable of delivering such weapons, while preserving
useful civilian applications.
In order to make progress in conventional
disarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention
providing for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel
mines comes into force as soon as possible.
Sixth, we should continue to combat
underdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no
further demonstration. France remains heavily committed;
it is the second largest provider of official development
assistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more
effective, France has decided to reform its cooperation
arrangements and increase coordination with other donors
— in the first place with the European Union. More than
60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European
Union. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin
America and the second largest to Asia.
France would like development resources to be more
predictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals
that we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the
idea of a development account. We encourage the United
Nations to continue its discussions in this area.
Seventh, we need to work with the non-
governmental organizations. They are capable of sounding
the alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very
practical terms to help build States governed by the rule
of law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the
activities of Mrs. Robinson, United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission
on Human Rights and in the various United Nations
agencies, which must also — all of them — integrate the
human rights dimension into their activities.
After more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will
see the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of
human rights. This is a crucial text because these are the
rights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.
17


However, even if we reinforce the Security Council,
strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better
handle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this
will still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and
for that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide
regulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.
The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in
all its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International
Criminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive
negotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against
the impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of
the first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential
synthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and
strikes a balance between the Court’s competences and the
powers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the
spirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those
countries that still have reservations will be able to join us.
In another field of law, the International Labour
Organization has taken a historic step towards universal
compliance with basic labour standards through the
declaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is
a commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the
Organization.
On 11 November 1997 the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted
the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and
Human Rights. This is the first normative framework to
guide the international community in an area of scientific
research where advances are already shaking our traditional
concepts of life and social organization. France is
submitting a draft resolution calling on the General
Assembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.
Ninth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of
organized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of
illegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8
per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the
International Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations
represent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross
domestic product.
At the special session in New York in June we
decided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for
drugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let
us do so.
Tenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,
whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.
The recent International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step
forward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the
means to hunt down those who finance and instigate these
attacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal
convention against the financing of terrorism.
We need to define concrete mechanisms for legal
measures and mutual judicial assistance against those who
finance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure
or the freezing of the assets of organizations or
individuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be
provided for. Innovative measures, such as making it
impossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies
investigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we
have the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at
the end of the present session of the General Assembly.
President Clinton spoke here on Monday of this
common struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.
In addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that
breed terrorism.
The eleventh point I would like to make concerns
the remedy for not only the current financial crises, but
also the malfunctioning of the international financial
system as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the
increasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financial
globalization is running wild now. New means urgently
need to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to
make its contribution. We need also to define new rules
adapted to today’s financial realities. My country is today
presenting to its European partners some proposals to
counter international financial instability.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) must
naturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be
more legitimate and more effective, working on the basis
of clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,
cooperating with other competent bodies, organizing
dialogue between industrialized countries and emerging
countries, ensuring the transparency of the financial
system and reflecting the economic, social and political
realities of partner countries — an IMF that can detect
early warning signs to prevent crises from happening.
Within this transformation, to which the Director-
General of the IMF is making an important contribution,
and also in order better to stabilize the international
economic and monetary situation and to support world
growth, Europe will play an increasingly important role
18


since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,
the euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.
From this period we are living through, which is so
full of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and
of crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular
those made under the aegis of the United Nations,
additional progress must be forthcoming in building a more
just and more peaceful world, because this is what we all
want.
Today’s world needs rules. The United Nations must
remain the unifying framework, and the Charter must
remain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its
worth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of
regulation — these are three main areas for our work.








Today’s world offers
one clear lesson: to survive and prosper, we have to work
together better. That much is clear.
We share a global environment. We depend on each
other for development and prosperity. Regional conflicts
affect us all. Our peoples suffer together under the
shadows of drugs and terrorism.
We can no longer separate what we want to achieve
within our own borders from what we face across our
borders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recently
can inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that fear
together.
And if our finance, our trade, media,
communications and even our culture are, day by day,
more and more transnational, it would be strange and
potentially dangerous if our politics remained locked in
the old compartments built just after the Second World
War. If the challenge is international, then the response
must be international too. We must launch a new era of
international partnership in which we modernize those
institutions that allow us to cooperate and to work
together.
The United Nations has a real record of
achievement. That is true. But it is true also that it has
had its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectively
when brutality was abroad. It has sometimes delivered
words when action was needed.
But the United Nations is no more than its Member
States. Its failures are our failures. The values of the
United Nations Charter are as valid now as when they
were written. But we have to find new ways of applying
them.
So I believe in the United Nations, but I also believe
it must modernize, and do so urgently. All parts of the
United Nations need proper accountability to go with
secure funding, better management and more effective
coordination in all their activities.
Our Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it is
now up to us, the Member States, to give him our full
support. We must not allow reform in the United Nations
to falter.
And let me emphasize today that we need to
strengthen too the authority of the Security Council. This
means broadening its composition: new permanent
seats — for the developing world as well as for Germany
and Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be an
unacceptable compromise. We have been talking about
this now for five years. It is time for decisions.
28


We face many challenges, but none more immediate
than the contagion of recession spreading from those
countries currently in difficulty to affect the wider world
economy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts to
impose new panoplies of controls on international capital
movements, or in a retreat from open trade. Rather, we
must all recognize that the absence of proper financial
structures and disciplines in individual countries, coupled
with a lack of transparency, will be punished by the
markets sooner or later.
However, we can act. We can devise new mechanisms
to support a process of change: rules to encourage greater
transparency in international and national financial dealings;
better supervision and regulation of financial operators;
adequate resources for the international financial institutions
to deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reform
programmes for countries in difficulty, programmes that
take account of the social effects of the restructuring we are
asking for.
The only way to tackle such complex problems is a
new, high-level, international collaborative effort. Global
problems will require global solutions. As Chairman of the
G-8, Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessary
look at the international financial architecture and how it
can be improved for a new age. This is a priority, I believe,
for us all.
However, we know that, unlike in the 1950s, this
cannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Getting
the financial framework right is only a start. We must
create the conditions for sustainable development in all our
countries.
The international community has set itself exacting
targets. Most important is the target to halve the proportion
of people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Our
own development effort is now geared to the eradication of
poverty. I told last year’s special session that we would
reverse the decline in our development assistance. Recently
we have announced that we are raising our development
budget by £1.6 billion, and our support for health,
education and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. We
have helped pay for the World Health Organization’s
campaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put our
money where our mouth is.
Of course, however, these development programmes
only work if the conditions are right, and too much money
has been wasted over the years. That is again why the work
the United Nations is doing to create strong development
partnerships is so important and must be given our full
backing. I call today on all parts of the United Nations
system, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the
World Trade Organization, to give top priority to effective
coordination of their development efforts. The poor of
this world will otherwise be the losers.
If we want to eradicate poverty, we also need to
ensure that the least developed countries benefit from this
global economy. That means, for example, letting them
sell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. It
means actively helping them benefit from globalization.
And it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.
The European Union is committed to zero tariffs for
these countries by the year 2000. And I would urge all
developed countries to follow suit.
We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorest
countries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate to
speed up assistance for those in the debt trap who are
genuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year
2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should have
embarked on a systematic process of debt reduction, with
the aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. But
we need to make sure it happens. Again, a huge
collaborative effort between the countries represented here
today will be needed.
Development must not be at the expense of the
environment. We all know this. But, again, this is a
challenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-run
thing. Buenos Aires will be hard work, but it has to work.
Countries with the biggest emissions must come forward
quickly with credible plans to meet their Kyoto
commitments. We in Britain will shortly publish a
consultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.
And I hope that others will come forward and do the
same.
The world has high expectations of the United
Nations as the guardian of global peace and security. The
United Nations should not get involved if regional
organizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. But
sometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.
And if we act, we must act decisively. Clear principles
must be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.
First, prevention is always better than cure. The
resources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared to
the expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.
The United Nations is building up its capacity in this
29


area, but it needs more support — and again Britain
pledges to play its part.
Secondly, where we do have to send in the Blue
Helmets, they should be given a clear and achievable task.
There must be no repeat of Bosnia, where peacekeepers
were inserted into a live conflict and told to make safe
areas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.
United Nations peacekeepers need a way out as well
as a way in. They must have the tools to do the job, and
clear and effective command.
Thirdly, the United Nations needs to be able to act and
respond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating,
underpin a fragile truce, save lives. Again, we in Britain are
trying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armed
forces following our Strategic Defence Review is
transforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-
reaction forces, additional strategic lift and better logistics
capability.
I can announce today that within six months we will
conclude a specific agreement with the United Nations to
ensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offer
when it is needed — the first such agreement by a
permanent member.
Fourthly, peacekeeping has to be accompanied from
the start by peace-building, to restore justice, democratic
institutions, prosperity and human rights. The Security
Council has to deal with the symptoms of conflict, not
simply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of the
United Nations, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again, I will
be asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposals
dealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict to
make this a reality.
Too many of those conflicts sill abound. There are few
higher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakes
region. The Middle East peace process remains an apparent
deadlock. We have managed to make progress in Northern
Ireland, and the support of the world community in our
doing so has given us great strength and courage to carry
on. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support, and I hope
that the world will continue it. I believe now is the time for
a further move forward in the Middle East, too. Again, we
in Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.
I want to focus, however, on one other area of
urgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that, yet
again, the security forces of President Milosevic´ are
ignoring the clear will of the international community and
inflicting brutality and repression on those they claim to
see as fellow citizens. Of course, we recognize that the
unacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army have contributed to the present appalling situation.
But nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forcible
creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
We have some clear responsibilities in this situation
as an international community. First, we must make it
clear that our patience with broken promises — phoney
assurances that are not honoured — is exhausted.
Continuation of military repression will inevitably lead to
a new kind of response. Secondly, we must impress on
both sides the need to negotiate, with a realistic
appreciation of what is possible, and point the way to a
mutually acceptable solution. Thirdly, we must make it
clear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarian
needs of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent, by any
means necessary, the humanitarian disaster which we can
see just over the horizon as winter approaches.
We propose a new Security Council resolution
calling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding an
urgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitants
of Kosovo. It should be adopted this week, and President
Milosevic´ would ignore such a resolution at his peril.
The international community faces another serious
challenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous in
insisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the United
Nations, and Kofi Annan courageously reached an
important agreement with the Iraqi leadership about the
United Nations Special Commission earlier this year.
Again, this agreement has to be honoured, and we will
play our part in ensuring that it is.
Finally, we face two global scourges which can
undermine our institutions and, indeed, our way of life:
drugs and terrorism. We all know the growing links
between drugs and crime and instability in so many
countries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have on
all who come near them — growers, smugglers, pushers
and users alike. We have, as we know, to tackle every
link of the drugs chain, but we are in danger of losing
sight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If we
are honest with ourselves, this is a war that we are risking
losing, but we must win. Britain, again, is spending a
30


further £200 million at the national level on our priorities,
but our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.
We are not short of organizations looking at this
problem; indeed, there may well be too many. But we are
desperately short of results: cutting supply lines, eliminating
illicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drug
dealers. We have a new instrument, the convention against
organized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuary
for the proceeds of crime. We must demand together that
those countries root out the traffickers and their dirty
money — hit the drug barons where it hurts. The
convention will provide practical means to achieve this, but
the negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the task
of completing them by the millennium, at the latest.
The fight against terrorism has also taken on a new
urgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includes
Luxor, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi, Omagh and many others.
Each one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaric
and cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terrorists
are no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder that
terrorism should have no hiding place and no
opportunity to raise funds, and that there should be no
let-up in our determination to bring its perpetrators
justice. This applies to the new phenomenon of stateless
terrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.
As a start, it is surely vital that all countries sign up
to the 11 international conventions to ensure that terrorists
have no safe haven. We have ourselves, again, in Britain,
just passed new legislation to ensure we can tackle
terrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But we
must go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only if
we all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome the
recent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-
raising for terrorism on an international basis. As
Chairman of the G-8, I again offer today to host a high-
level conference in London this autumn to deny the
terrorists this means of support. Effective new measures
on an agreed international basis could make a real
difference.
I have covered many points in my speech to the
Assembly, but my main point is really a very simple one.
We face multiple new challenges as we approach the new
century. Our only hope, as we all know, of tackling these
challenges successfully is tackling them together. We
need effective international cooperation and modern
institutions to deal with our political problems and our
economic problems. We need the United Nations system
pulling together as never before. We need to revitalize
and modernize our international institutions to deal with
the crisis in the global economy. But, above all, we need
political will and a sense of urgency. The problems of our
modern world are too pressing, their consequences too
immediate, their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitate
or to look away any longer. We are being given a
warning to act, to give purpose and direction in resolving
these challenges we face together, or pay the price. And
the time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now.I congratulate you, Sir, on
your election to the presidency of the General Assembly
at its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our shared
endeavours in the United Nations and offer you our full
cooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor for
his commitment and contribution, and to commend him
for his work throughout the last year.
I first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Minister
in 1977. Since then I have for many years had the
privilege to attend General Assembly sessions, but
without ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge with
gratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.
To me, this also signifies the consensus on the national
interests and the foreign policy of India. When I
addressed the General Assembly in 1977, it was in many
ways a turning point in the history of India. The Janata
Government was a coalition of many factions, which
united in the restoration of our people?s faith in
democracy. Since then we have had many changes of
Government, but the people?s political awareness and
their faith in the institutions which uphold our
constitutional system has been unwavering. Today, when
I come to this rostrum as Prime Minister, I come on
behalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated that
democracy can take root in a developing country. I am
confident that the Indian experience will prove that
democracy can also provide the basis for stable, long-term
economic growth in developing societies. That is the path
that the people of India have chosen, and I stand before
the Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgent
India.

The world of the 1970s has receded into history. The
shackling constraints of the cold war are gone. The
distinguishing feature of the last two decades has been the
spread of democracy worldwide. By force of example, we
have been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.
From this flows our desire to see the democratization of the
United Nations itself. An international body that does not
reflect, and change with, changing international realities
will inevitably face a credibility deficit. We therefore
support a revitalized and more effective United Nations,
one that is more responsive to the concerns of the vast
majority of its Member States and is better equipped to
meet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-first
century.
The Security Council does not represent contemporary
reality; it does not represent democracy in international
relations. Following the end of the cold war, it acquired the
freedom to act, but experience shows that the Council has
acted only when it was convenient for its permanent
members. The experience of Somalia does not do credit to
the Security Council — and there are other examples too.
Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulterior
political priorities and perceptions.
There is only one cure: to bring in new blood. The
Security Council must be made representative of the
membership of the United Nations. Developing countries
must be made permanent members. This is a right to which
the developing world is entitled. The presence of some
developing countries as permanent members is inescapable
if the responsibilities of the Security Council are to be
effectively discharged, particularly when we see that the
Council acts almost exclusively in the developing world. It
is only natural that on decisions affecting the developing
world, these countries should have a say, on equal terms.
Along with other measures, the Security Council too must
be reformed, expanding its non-permanent membership so
that more developing countries can serve on it. But that
alone is not enough, because as long as effective power in
the Council rests with the permanent membership, the
interests of the developing world will not be promoted or
protected unless developing countries are made permanent
members on a par with the present permanent members.
Only this will make the Council an effective instrument for
the international community in dealing with current and
future challenges.
The new permanent members must of course have
the ability to discharge the responsibilities that come with
permanent membership. India believes it has that ability,
and, as we have said before from this rostrum, we are
prepared to accept the responsibilities of permanent
membership, and believe we are qualified for it.
It will be a great day when democracy becomes the
universal norm, and when the United Nations reflects that
democracy in its institutions and functioning. However,
open democratic societies have one scourge to contend
with: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mine
and other democracies is to maintain our openness,
safeguard individual rights, and at the same time give no
quarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me have
recounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exacted
worldwide, taking advantage of the trust that characterizes
open societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summit
almost two decades back identified terrorism as one of the
most serious threats to civilized societies. Events since
then, including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishka
aircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, and the
recent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, have only
established the correctness of that judgement.
Terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.
Terrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is the
most vicious among international crimes, and the most
pervasive, pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives of
men and women in open societies, and to international
peace and security. In India, we have had to cope with
terrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country for
nearly two decades. We have borne this with patience, but
none should doubt the strength of our resolve to crush
this challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.
Today, it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms and
with money-laundering. In short, terrorism has gone
global and it can only be defeated by organized
international action.
Let us make up our minds once and for all: terrorism
is a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardly
stand scrutiny in an open society, let alone in the eyes of
the international community. It should be the primary task
of all open and pluralist societies to develop collective
means for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting in
Durban, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called
for an international conference in 1999 to develop such a
collective response. We earnestly recommend that the
1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on an
international convention to provide for collective action
17


against States and organizations which initiate or aid and
abet terrorism.
Now, at the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, there is a growing realization
that economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights
form a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent years
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violations
of economic, social and cultural rights inevitably lead to
violations of civil and political rights. In defining its index,
the Human Development Report gives a higher weighting
to economic criteria for developing countries; this weighting
is reduced for developed countries, highlighting the
importance of the right to development for developing
societies. It is therefore a matter of concern that the
absolutism that some are seeking to advocate in the
promotion of human rights is often at the cost of the right
to development.
India has ratified both the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions in
our country — the National Human Rights Commission, a
free media and an independent judiciary — all serve to
ensure that the rights set out in international human rights
statutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remain
convinced that unless progress is made on economic, social
and cultural rights, including the right to development, the
world will continue to witness international conflict leading
to migrations, displacement of people and human rights
abuses.
In the closing years of the twentieth century, the
challenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the priorities
facing the international community. We have successfully
prohibited chemical and biological weapons in recent
decades. The present century has witnessed the
development and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. We
must ensure that the legacy of this weapon of mass
destruction is not carried into the next century.
For the last half-century, India has consistently
pursued the objectives of international peace, along with
equal and legitimate security for all through global
disarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets of
our national security. India has, over the years, sought to
enhance its national security by promoting global nuclear
disarmament, convinced that a world free of nuclear
weapons would enhance both global security and India?s
national security.
The negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate that
such a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects, to the
process of nuclear disarmament and, therefore, to the
enhancement of international peace and security. India
participated actively and constructively in the
negotiations, and sought to place the Treaty in a
disarmament framework by proposing its linkage with a
time-bound programme for the universal elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
It is a matter of history that India?s proposals were
not accepted. The Treaty, as it emerged, was not accepted
by India on grounds of national security. We made
explicit our objection that, despite our stand having been
made clear, the Treaty text made India?s signature and
ratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindful
of its deteriorating security environment, which obliged us
to stand apart from the CTBT in 1996, India undertook a
limited series of five underground tests, conducted on 11
and 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuring
a credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security in
the foreseeable future.
These tests do not signal a dilution of India?s
commitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.
Accordingly, after concluding this limited testing
programme, India announced a voluntary moratorium on
further underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyed
our willingness to move towards a de jure formalization
of that obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India has
already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In
1996, India could not have accepted the obligation, as
such a restraint would have eroded our capability and
compromised our national security.
India, having harmonized its national imperatives
and security obligations and desirous of continuing to
cooperate with the international community, is now
engaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a range
of issues, including the CTBT. We are prepared to bring
these discussions to a successful conclusion, so that the
entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyond
September 1999. We expect that other countries, as
indicated in article XIV of the Treaty, will adhere to it
without conditions.
After protracted discussions, the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva is now in a position to begin
negotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the production
of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
18


explosive devices. Once again, we are conscious that this is
a partial step. Such a treaty, as and when it is concluded
and enters into force, will not eliminate existing nuclear
arsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations in
good faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-
discriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. India
will pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiatives
in this area during the course of the negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament.
As a responsible State committed to non-proliferation,
India has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons
or related know-how to other countries. We have an
effective system of export controls and shall make it more
stringent where necessary, including by expanding control
lists of equipment and technology to make them more
contemporary and effective in the context of a nuclear
India. At the same time, as a developing country, we are
conscious that nuclear technology has a number of peaceful
applications, and we shall continue to cooperate actively
with other countries in this regard, in keeping with our
international responsibilities.
A few weeks ago, at the Non-Aligned Summit in
Durban, India proposed, and the Movement agreed, that an
international conference be held, preferably in 1999, with
the objective of arriving at an agreement before the end of
this millennium on a phased programme for the complete
elimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all members
of the international community, and particularly the other
nuclear-weapon States, to join in this endeavour. Let us
pledge that when we assemble here in the new millennium
it will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shall
never again be subjected to the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons.
The decade of the 1990s has fallen far short of
expectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the
global economic scene. The sense of triumphalism that
heralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving way
to caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asian
flu is now spreading to other continents.
The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows would
foster economic development, with the global financial
markets adjusting the exchange rates, stands falsified. What
we have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtual
money” that has not been generated by productive
economic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” is
real, evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanisms
are unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movement
in and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short run
follows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment,
with results that are self-reinforcing. In developing
countries and in western financial capitals, there is now
a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of
capital markets has been a primary cause of the current
crisis.
Does it mean that the world should turn back from
globalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Rising
economic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by the
technological imperative, but we must learn how to
manage the change. India has not been affected as
severely as some other countries, largely because we
adopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop in
commodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and a
reduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by
50 per cent will have a negative impact on growth
everywhere, including in the developed world.
I must emphasize that democratically elected
leadership in an open developing society such as India
also faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridled
free market system aggravate existing economic and
social disparities. In fact, we need policy instruments to
reduce disparities, thus creating a more stable
environment in the long term. Such policies are necessary
in accountable democracies and are in no way
inconsistent with managed liberalization.
It is high time that we begin a new international
dialogue on the future of a global and interdependent
economy. This is a task for the sovereign States
represented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamics
of an unregulated market place.
I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are
on the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase,
but we are all aware that an exciting new universe is
within our reach. Several centuries ago, Isaac Newton
described his scientific discoveries as pebbles on the
beach, while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It was
modest of that great scientist to so describe his work, but
I believe that we are now actually sailing
in the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveries
and will make many more which will move humankind
forward.
And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is not
well. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost all
parts of the world forces are bubbling under the surface
tranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and
19


seek to lead the world towards bigotry, violence and
unhealthy exclusivism.
India has a message — not a new one, for almost all
religions have expressed the thought before. But we have
preserved the tenets of freedom, equality and tolerance in
our daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is to
be a better place than the world we have seen so far, these
values must prevail. History also shows that these are easier
to prescribe than to observe. And yet, as we move towards
ever closer interdependence, there is no alternative. The
world and its leaders must summon the will to rise to the
occasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This is
the task before us, and I declare India?s readiness to make
its full contribution in the testing times ahead.
I close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved as
composed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit, the oldest
language in the world:
“Svastir manushebhyaha
Oordhvam Jugatu beshajam
Sam no astu dvipathe
Sam Chathusthpate
Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti”
This means: Let all human beings be blessed with
prosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of all
creatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with all
two-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-
legged creations. Let there be peace, peace, peace.







As the Prime Minister of
Israel, I represent a State whose creation was envisioned,
encouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80
years ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. That
extraordinary recognition by the international community
confirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt for
two millennia: the bond between the people of Israel and
the land of Israel is eternal, and the rebirth of the Jewish
State in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.
Religious and non-religious people alike have viewed
this rebirth as a modern miracle, the realization of the
vision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracle
occurred, we have all been hoping that it would be
accompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:
“nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible,
Isaiah 2:4)
It was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israel
stretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in our
Declaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now, half
a century later, as we view with pride our nation?s
extraordinary accomplishments and achievements, we are
determined to complete the circle of peace around us. No
people have suffered more from war and violence than the
Jewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. I
know that that is not a common perception of us. I,
personally, am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothing
could be further from the truth. I have been on the fields of
battle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two small
children at home. I want a future free of war — a future of
peace, for them and for Palestinian children like them.
We want peace for us and for the Palestinian people,
whose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruel
consequences of the wars waged against us. We are willing
to make painful compromises for peace. We hope that the
Palestinians are ready to make those necessary
compromises as well. What is at stake is our life together
in a very small land, and there is no reason that we should
not be able to live together. All of us are, after all, the sons
and daughters of Abraham.
As we search for peace, we naturally encounter
crises and stalemates, frustrations and obstacles — that is
inevitable in any negotiating process. But only
negotiations can solve our problems. An outcome which
is not the result of negotiations is an invitation to
continued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violence
and threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h e
option of violence must therefore be totally discarded and
permanently disavowed.
Peace will be achieved only by heeding the call
made by two great leaders, the late Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared in
Jerusalem, “No more war. No more bloodshed”.
The Treaty they hammered out at Camp David was
a historic turning point which changed the face of our
region. It has benefited both countries and brought hope
to all of us, as has the peace with Jordan, which is a
model peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?s
contribution to this peace, his devotion to the
advancement of our relationship and his efforts to help
the peace process with the Palestinians have been
invaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and, I am
sure, on behalf of all the peoples and Governments
represented in the Assembly, I want to send King Hussein
our most heartfelt wishes for a quick and complete
recovery.
I believe we can achieve a successful peace
agreement with the Palestinians as well. But for that
peace to endure, it must be based on two principles. The
first is security. A peace that cannot be defended will not
last. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.
None of us can afford to forget this lesson, least of all the
Jewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one Jewish
State, I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself,
regardless of criticism and misunderstanding by those
who do not share this responsibility.
The second principle of a durable peace is
reciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides can
be successful. The agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: the
Palestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in which
they live, and in return they prevent terrorist attacks
against Israel from those territories. Israel has been
fulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of the
Palestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of the
Palestinians in Judean Samaria, known as the West Bank,
are now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the
13


attributes of self-government: they have their own flag,
their own executive, legislative and judiciary bodies and
their own police force.
It can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel is
occupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.
But we cannot accept a situation in which they will threaten
our lives, and that is of paramount concern to us as we
approach further redeployment.
The territory we are negotiating about is virtually
uninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a few
thousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land is
the canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history
have been etched. And it has powerful implications for our
security. We should remember that at its widest point Israel
is all of 50 miles wide, and should it cede all of the West
Bank, as some so cavalierly tell us to do, that distance
would be reduced to the distance between this building and
La Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaders
would put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we are
prepared to undertake careful, controlled and calculated
risks for peace. Nevertheless, to part with one square inch
of this land is agonizing for us, and for me personally.
Every stone and every hill and valley that I have walked —
I know them intimately, as do my people — resonates with
our forefathers? footsteps, from the cradle of Jewish
civilization through the biblical kings and prophets and the
sages, scholars and poets of Israel, down to our own time.
Yet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation we
have agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some of
this hallowed land, provided that the principles of security
and reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retain
the ability to defend itself, and that the Palestinians would
fulfil their commitments, first and foremost to shun
violence and fight terrorism.
Under the Oslo and Hebron agreements, which I
signed, the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat
agreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrest
and prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collect
and dispose of illegal weapons, imprison and hand over
wanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to the
numbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has not
been done to date. They also agreed to cease the vicious
daily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there are
Sesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds to
become suicide warriors. This, I am afraid, is education for
war, not for peace. And they agreed that they must
complete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter, which
can only be done by the Palestinian National Council. That
Charter is still on the books and still on the Internet — if
representatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls for
Israel?s destruction thorough armed struggle, which is a
euphemism for terrorism. So I say today to our
Palestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. You
cannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”.
Of course, terrorism endangers our peace, but it is
also a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this,
as President Clinton made abundantly clear from this very
podium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorism
rooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerous
is that the terrorists invoke a distorted, twisted and fanatic
interpretation of Islam, which is very distant from
enlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It is
one of the world?s great religions, and we have
admiration and respect for its institutions and its
teachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religion
betrayed, and it not only threatens us but undermines
Arab Governments and societies. It endangers the peace
of the world.
For terrorism to be defeated, terrorists must be
punished and deterred, and the climate of support they
enjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the only
way that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrested
and that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.
The elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly lead
to prosperity in our region. We envision a market-based
regional economy between Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting the
barriers to trade, eliminating red tape and promoting joint
business ventures between the parties. Trade between
Israel and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in the
last two years because our policy is a liberal policy. If
things are better for them economically, things are better
for us. I should like to give an example relating to the
transfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinian
workers working in Israel, whose numbers have grown
enormously in the last two years. Three years ago we
transferred about 700 million shekels to the Palestinian
Authority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.
This year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That is
almost a threefold increase in three years. Representatives
do not know that; none of them knows that we have
dramatically improved the Palestinian economy because
we believe that life better for them is life better for us.
The absence of violence will enable all of us,
Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians and Israelis, and, I
may add, Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far-
14


fetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach a
standard of living and quality of life now considered
unimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we will
begin negotiations for the final settlement — a final
settlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.
I urged starting these negotiations a year ago, but I
regret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase is
long overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted, no dates
in the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in them
was met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did not
put an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are not
about meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reach
a peace agreement through negotiations.
An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
State, in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo, would
constitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. It
would cause the complete collapse of the process. I strongly
urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Such
actions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on our
part, and that development would not be good for the
Palestinians, not good for Israel, and not good for peace.
We must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously
and tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. No
other way will do.
What would such a peace look like? I envision its
success would lie in ensuring the following balance: the
Palestinians should have all the powers to govern their lives
and none of the powers to threaten our lives. They will
have control of all aspects of their society, such as law,
religion and education; industry, commerce and agriculture;
tourism, health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.
What they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have a
right to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not become
the base for hostile forces, including foreign forces. We
have a right to ensure that it does not become a base and
haven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about a
base — in New York city terms — five blocks away, and
without the East River. We are talking about something that
is not hypothetical.
As I prepared this speech, I was informed of a
terrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem, in a bus
station. Happily, no one was killed today. But can we be
sure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful, that is not
violent — a peace without terror, which is the only peace
that means anything.
Nor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons such
as anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities and
airfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Aviv
airport — as many have in the past — their planes could
be endangered by the inability of Israel, in a permanent
peace settlement, to control the importation of these lethal
weapons. This is the great challenge of the permanent
status negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that will
strike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israeli
security. This peace can be achieved by negotiation, and
negotiation alone. There is no other way.
Negotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanon
and Syria as well. As representatives know, over six
months ago our Government announced an initiative to
implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In our
decision, we said that Israel was prepared to withdraw
from south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:
that there would be security arrangements to ensure the
safety of the civilian population on both sides of the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
I can report that I find myself now in the bizarre
position of offering to withdraw from an Arab country
and meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such a
withdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.
We have not abandoned this initiative.
Peace with Syria and Lebanon will complete the
circle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But the
achievement of a lasting peace in our region requires
addressing the ominous existential dangers which still
threaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iran
and Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventional
weapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iran
has just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.
Iraq has declared that it will no longer accept
international inspections of its non-conventional
programmes, inspections mandated by Security Council
resolutions.
These developments threaten not only Israel, but all
the nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of the
rogue regimes of the Middle East, weapons of mass
destruction may pose a greater threat to the world, and to
world peace, than anything we have known in the past. I
want to caution members about something else: to let
sweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inaction
is to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What is
required instead is concerted international action to
prevent disaster.
15


That, after all, is what this body was established to do.
And if it is to live up to its founders? expectations, it will
have to be far more adept at distinguishing between
fanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believe
that the United Nations can help foster a climate of peace
and stability in our region by encouraging the reactivation
of the multilateral committees conceived at the Madrid
Conference. By addressing such issues as regional
economic development, arms control, the resolution of
refugee problems, water and the environment, these
committees can produce the important building blocks of
peace.
But ultimately, as in every conflict, the crucial
decisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle East
themselves. They must decide whether the region will
continue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become a
full participant in a peaceful, prosperous global economy.
Cooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leading
position in the world of the next millennium. Violence,
terrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.
Deep in our hearts, we know which choice we want
for our children. My wife and I hope that when our two
little boys grow up, the only competition they will engage
in with Palestinian boys, and Egyptian boys, and Jordanian
and Syrian and Lebanese boys, will be on football fields
and in debating societies.
It is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.
It is the name of our national anthem. It is what has made
it possible for us, despite unparalleled persecution, despite
the most horrific calamities to befall any people or any
nation, clinging to hope, to contribute as much as we have
to human progress in the past 4,000 years. And this hope is
reflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebrate
the Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from our
eternal capital Jerusalem, the city of peace, to all our
neighbours and to all present here today: “May the year and
its maledictions end, and a new year and its blessings
begin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year.













May I start, Sir, by
congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of
this great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides
its deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,
Uruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth
and hospitality on that occasion.
I would also like to express our thanks to his
predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with
considerable commitment, presided over the introduction
of many important reform measures during the past
session.
Each year this debate provides an opportunity to take
a longer perspective on the United Nations — to look
back and, of course, to look ahead. We have
achievements to acknowledge and challenges for the
future to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by
present-day conditions. We are living in very difficult
times. The economic events that have unfolded over the
last year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a
global impact. They will affect developed and developing
countries alike across most regions of the world. The
problems that face us demand a calm and steady response
if financial troubles are not to spill over into wider
instability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and
a test of the component parts of the multilateral system.
This year we mark 50-year milestones in two major
areas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish
this half-century from earlier times: international
peacekeeping and the development of international human
rights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the
challenges of the present day. Both typify the unique
contribution of the United Nations system. It is in this
global setting that universal international norms can be
established. The international rule of law gives us a
framework with which to deal confidently with the
7


problems that confront us. And it is through collective
security that the countries of the world can work together
to promote and reinforce peace and stability.
New Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset
valued the opportunities for global debate and collective
action provided by the United Nations. We are committed
to the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective
operation is essential to the well-being of our world.
We are, of course, as many are, conscious of the
criticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in
recent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was
very high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding
a new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the
decade there was talk of a new world order.
But the world community?s expectations of what could
be achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own
political will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,
which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,
proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to
respond effectively.
Euphoria about the United Nations began to give way
to cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the
United Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a
longer view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is
the appropriate reaction.
Since the end of the cold war the United Nations
peacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.
There have been some marked successes and, regrettably,
some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping
mandates must reflect the lessons learned.
The need for the United Nations to be able to carry
out its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to
what it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the
blue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive
timely reimbursement.
The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and
the regular budget cast a long shadow over the
Organization. Dues outstanding at present have reached
alarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and
small nations.
We cannot afford to have the capacity of the United
Nations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.
In my own area of the South Pacific we developed
a regional response to a regional problem. I am referring
to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an
island which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but
has enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the
Governments of the region that set out to help the
Government of Papua New Guinea and representatives of
the Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.
The contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon
Islands and my own country have played a valuable and
significant role, and there is now growing hope and
confidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for
almost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing
the ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations
participation. We welcomed the United Nations decision
to set up a small political office on the island. This
commitment by the United Nations will help strengthen
the peace process there.
Today the world faces uncertainty caused by the
financial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the
Russian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin
America under pressure and is now touching just about
everybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and
the reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has
dramatically changed economic and social prospects.
World economic growth this year will be significantly
reduced.
This most serious economic situation in many years
has the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must
cooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national
level we must take the actions required, not just for our
own sakes but in the interests of the broader international
community. This includes refraining from protectionist
reactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing
ahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.
A serious challenge is to ensure that economic
insecurity does not threaten political and social stability.
We must resist pressures to take political actions that we
would normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is
through a collective approach to the problems that
confront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in
the United Nations system and elsewhere and build
confidence in our joint ability to work through difficult
times.
I was particularly struck by the comments of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in
his statement on Monday. His characterization of the
8


crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social
or political, but all of these things at once — is exactly
right. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s
conclusion that we must address the crisis on all these
fronts.
As a forum for debate, and as a body capable of
taking global action, the United Nations, together with its
specialized agencies, has an important role to play in
building capacity and providing social support where it is
needed. Much of what the United Nations has achieved
provides the norms and mechanisms to help us through
difficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The
challenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle
the problems that have the potential to undermine our
security, problems that have their greatest impact on
ordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the
time to go backwards.
Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
have underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from
over. The response to terrorism must be decisive and
unequivocal. The international community has a duty to
ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.
Universal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist
instruments must be a fundamental objective of all
Members of this Organization.
War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a
resurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New
Zealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes
Tribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not
enough. New Zealand has long called for an international
criminal court that would have jurisdiction over such
crimes. We commend the effort of those who, through
much hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the
Statute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.
It is our expectation that, with the support of the
international community, the Court will prove an effective
tool in the fight against those who carry out appalling
atrocities.
Nowhere is the need for multilateral action more
clearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental
degradation and promote sustainable development.
New Zealand is honoured to have our own
Environment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair
the Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh
session. It is our strong hope that this session will see us
advance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards
achieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years
ago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of
the Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and
seas and the review of the Barbados Programme of
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States in preparation for next year?s special
session of the General Assembly.
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted last
December was a positive first step in dealing with this
quintessentially global problem. There remain some
important implementation issues to be resolved. The
Fourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will
provide an opportunity to make further progress.
Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,
we now have an Organization that is efficient and
effective. There is more to be done if this great
Organization is to meet the challenges of the present day:
changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from the
administration of the Organization to its front-line work
in development and confronting global problems.
New Zealand looks forward to continuing the
dialogue on financing for development. Through our
current membership of the Economic and Social Council
we have followed closely the evolving debate on this very
important issue. We very much welcome the initiatives
taken by the Organization towards closer linkages with
the Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are
themselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the
present economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge
they have ever had. However, we must decide whether in
their present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first
century.
This Organization, too, like any other, needs to
respond to changing circumstances, and be flexible
enough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world
of today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.
The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need
to address anew the divide between North and South. The
United Nations development role is crucial. Once again I
believe the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head
when he described in his statement on Monday the need
to restore development to its proper place in global
economic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up
trade and investment flows, and promote access to
information and technology. All of these are tools with
which to fight the economic downturn which is
confronting us.
9


The United Nations clearly has the leading role to play
in development. Other international institutions play a
complementary part. I am personally conscious of the
particular contribution made by the Commonwealth through
the recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That
Mission highlighted the special vulnerability of small
States, which has led to the establishment of the
Commonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which
will have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social
Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.
Within the United Nations we need to correct the
North-South imbalance to which I referred through reform
of the Security Council. More equitable representation on
the Council would better reflect the world as it is and
today?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex
issue, but there has been some good progress this year in
the equally important area of reforming the Council?s
working methods. Altogether, these are matters which
require careful consideration and negotiation. Setting
artificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform
package would not be helpful and could in fact prove
damaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the
support of the greatest possible number of Member States.
I should add that regional groups in the United
Nations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly
open to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to
create a more equitable distribution of electoral
opportunities and to recognize modern-day political and
economic linkages.
In the field of disarmament and arms control, it is
timely to consider how far we have come and what we
have achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end
of nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm
was shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising
grave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken
some encouragement from statements made in this Hall in
recent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which
all countries that have not yet done so will sign up
unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty.
The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to
proceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off
treaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations
concluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping
back from the objective of complete disarmament, including
the elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s
commitment to this objective was reiterated in the
declaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers
of seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand
is now working with those countries on a draft resolution
based on the concerns outlined in the declaration.
One achievement which I personally see as a top
priority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification
protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
Their Destruction. Following a very successful initiative
from Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of
ministers who this week issued a statement urging
Governments to commit themselves to completing this
task.
New Zealand supports the actions of the United
Nations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of
weapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to
the security of the region. We urge the Government of
Iraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission so that the elimination of these
dreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security
Council can once more address the question of lifting
sanctions.
In the 50 years since Member States adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance
of the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time
again. Yet there remains much to be done before the
vision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be
realized for all. We are confident that, under the
leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
we will continue to make good progress towards the
realization of that vision.
The United Nations can add value in promoting and
protecting fundamental human rights standards,
emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have
been supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this
area, and we will continue to do so.
We see countries in all regions of the world seeking
the international community?s support as they build
structures to provide good governance and deliver hope
and greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am
encouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra
Leone in this regard.
As the last 50 years have demonstrated, this
Organization has added a whole new dimension to
10


cooperation among nations. No lesser body could have
achieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it
will be the dramatic development of the international rule
of law and the evolution of collective approaches to
security, both political and economic, which will
characterize our era. In other words, that really is the work
of the United Nations.
Now, with the challenge of the economic problems
that face us, we nations of the world are more dependent
than ever on solving our shared problems together. New
Zealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations
and to the ideals that this Organization stands for.









Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds
of the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on
all of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding
collectively to new challenges and in establishing a
reliable system of international security and stability once
we have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes
accumulated during the century about to end.
This is not only possible, it is the imperative of our
times!
A well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would
live in the world, live in peaceâ€. It contains a highly
philosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will
live in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve
emerging problems through peaceful, political means.
States will live in peace and harmony once they have
recognized their interrelationship and interdependence and
started to seek collective responses to the challenges of
their times.
Experience confirms the truth of this popular
wisdom. The most recent example is the sharp
aggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis
which has besieged many countries, including Russia,
which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The
current upheaval in the world financial markets can be
overcome only by joint efforts that do not pursue
unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global
economic stability. Interaction of States in this process,
including within the framework of the United Nations,
must, on principle, be raised to a new level.
As for Russia, after overcoming an acute political
crisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the
Government and the leading political forces are making
vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial
situation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be
found.
From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not
deviate from the path of reform and will do its best to
pass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to
preserve the democratic progress that has been made but
also to augment it.
Likewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain
consistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards
building a democratic multipolar world, ensuring
interaction with other States in the interests of settling
international problems by political means and developing
broad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.
20


We are convinced that the problems before the world,
no matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the
basis of strict observance of international law and close
interaction among States. Multilateral organizations and
mechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.
Above all, this applies to the United Nations, which
continues to be the sole universal international
peacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than
any other world body to reach agreements on how to settle
conflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying
social and economic causes. It is important for United
Nations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional
organizations.
We highly value the level of interaction that now
exists between the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a
reliable partner in addressing complex European problems,
as well as interaction with the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The
international community has developed a unique arsenal of
political and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of
every international problem. It must be put to effective use.
Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last
resort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of
international law and above all by the United Nations
Charter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of
law rather than the law of force in international affairs.
The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this
year was settled precisely by political means, through the
joint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by
the United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic
evidence that the potential inherent in constructive and
active diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying
exclusively on military force.
A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us
deeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious
consequences for regional and international stability. No
doubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
implement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the
other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the
situation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of
mass destruction and answer the question of whether or not
that country still poses a threat to regional and overall
international security after seven years of work carried out
there by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the
world community is required today to finally unblock this
crisis situation.
Political logic must prevail over the logic of force in
our search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in
Kosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the
Kosovo conflict might lead to a major war with
unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and
Europe at large. It is our firm belief that a political
solution is the only possible way of settling the problem
of Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict
respect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.
The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of
the fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary
gains can be obtained in that country through the use of
arms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for
political solutions, with the United Nations playing a
central role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,
formation of an efficient central Government recognized
by all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs
territorial integrity and independence can realistically be
accomplished.
Collective political efforts are required to give a
second wind to the Middle East peace process. In our
view, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or
proposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has
stymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should
not be ignored that even if the Middle East process has
long-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has
consistently advocated the establishment of an
independent Palestinian State through political means and
negotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable
rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable
assurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be
realized.
In a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results
already achieved.
The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie
case has been a major accomplishment of the international
community. The adoption by the Security Council of a
relevant resolution was possible due to the constructive
approach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United
States, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due
to diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,
which were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed
without delay to its implementation.
21


Arguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the
efforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The
United Nations must play a leading role to this end.
Failure of the international community to fully
extinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in
Africa in recent years is a source of growing concern.
Moreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that
continent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to
achieve full coordination between the United Nations and
Africaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is
why the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on
Africa should focus on shaping a strong common stance
capable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of
Africaâs latest developments.
For objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention
to settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in
Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or
Trans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”
namely, promoting a political settlement and helping build
lasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia
has undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is
doing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can
prove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show
goodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more
meaningful international backing, above all from the United
Nations and the OSCE.
While making strong efforts to settle regional crises,
we should not lose sight of global problems, some of which
have acquired a new dimension in the last year.
We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of
a real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the
international community to encourage all countries to
accede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.
Russia is committed to the idea of continued reduction
of nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic
stability at lower armament levels. In this context, we
attach particularly great importance to the Russian-
American interaction in the area of reducing strategic
offensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,
Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian
Government, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to
seek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II
Treaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to
ratify all documents related to START II.
Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear
arms control process is now on the agenda. We urge
careful consideration of a proposal made by President
Boris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy
nuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of
their national territories. We note with satisfaction the
recent consensus decision in the Conference on
Disarmament to start negotiations banning production of
nuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of
special significance is that the decision was supported by
States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are
convinced that such a ban would be a further necessary
step in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation
regime and nuclear disarmament.
The nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear
terrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed
to be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our
regret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the
international community is required to prevent the real-
life emergence of that new form of terrorism.
Accelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts
of nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it
can be adopted by the General Assembly at the current
session, has become particularly relevant.
Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its
firm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations. International terrorism is one of the most
dangerous global challenges to international stability. It
can be successfully combated only through united action
by all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of
making unilateral power moves, shall we be able to
succeed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.
Militant separatism has become another factor that
destabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on
extremist methods in the struggle for the national rights
of minority groups within multinational States, separatism
often finds itself in league with terrorism and religious
fanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal
conflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get
involved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional
crises.
More than two and a half thousand national
minorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of
them to aspire to a State entity of their own, the
disastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be
imagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that
in mind.
22


The fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted
action. We must focus on the practical implementation of
the relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat
adopted by the General Assembly at its special session.
The international community should take a common
stand in implementing the provisions of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary
occurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is
needed in respect of those States which, under various
pretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and
freedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards
involving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level
of Government policy discrimination against a part of the
population. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking
citizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia
and Estonia. The international community, and above all the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
should closely watch the situation in those countries.
I have touched upon a few of the important issues
which the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this
time. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of
joint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal
with urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that
end, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms
and adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the
process of reforming the United Nations, launched by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The
rationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the
Organization.
That is the angle from which we approach the ongoing
discussion on the work of the Security Council. No one
should question the Security Councilâs primary
responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of
peace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its
effectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well
as to build on internal cohesion and work coordination
methods developed in recent years.
I should like to reaffirm that we support the
implementation of reforms and changes in United Nations
mechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the
United Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps
taken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United
Nations auspices, of the Statute of the International
Criminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on
ways to achieve international information security serves
the same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset
threats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science
and technology for purposes incompatible with the
maintenance of international security.
I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of
adapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of
an individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for
example, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in
mind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security
Council, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive
measures. We must not allow a precedent to be created
involving the use of military potential in a crisis situation
without the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is
obvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion
of the existing system of international relations, whose
central element is the United Nations.
United Nations sanctions as an instrument of
international coercion also require a highly balanced
approach. When introduced by the Security Council,
sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that
may be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.
They should not destabilize the economic situation in the
country subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.
It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the
imposition of sanctions and their duration and the
procedures for easing and lifting them.
In short, individual elements of the United Nations
mechanism need improvement and retooling. But we
should go about it with a full sense of responsibility,
mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary
harm is to be avoided at all costs.
Every session of the General Assembly is, in a way,
a milestone event. Each session is expected to make a
tangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems
confronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether
or not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly
lives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It
will depend on all of us whether or not joint effective
steps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful
world, a world free from war and conflict and from
financial and economic upheaval, a world built on the
principles of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands
ready to work with others to attain these goals.






Let me begin by thanking the
Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by
noting that, at the opening of this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.
Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The United
Nations is actively mediating crises before they explode
into war, all around the world. And today more people
determine their own destiny than at any previous moment
in history.
We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights with those rights more
widely embraced than ever before. On every continent
people are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and
a great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United
Nations.
Still, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise
of our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil
today threatens to undermine confidence in free markets
and democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from
this economy have a special responsibility to do more to
minimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global
markets to all citizens. And the United States is
determined to do that.
We still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious
and tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many
States to acquire such weapons.
And, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not
fading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a
continuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which says
9


“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
person.”
Here at the United Nations, at international summits
around the world and on many occasions in the United
States, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in
detail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing
and what we must yet do to combat terror.
Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about why
all nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of
our agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern
to us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted
over and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi
Arabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own
citizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public
buildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives
to building bridges between nations — people very much
like all of those present — died in a campaign of hatred
against the United States.
Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with
a powerful military and a worldwide presence active in
promoting peace and security, we are often a target. We
love our country for its dedication to political and religious
freedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights
of the individual. But we know that many people see us as
a symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they
find it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots
elsewhere.
But we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we
believe the best way to disprove these claims is to continue
our work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us
to pull back from the world’s trouble spots, to turn our
backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own
opposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace
a victory they must never have.
Still, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as
only, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a
clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and
innocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the
people represented here, is immune. Certainly not the
people of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American
killed there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500
more injured — innocent people going about their business
on a busy morning.
Not the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where
the wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants
alike — mostly children and women, two of them
pregnant — people out shopping together when their
future was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the
past.
Not the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin
gas in the Tokyo subway.
Not the people of Argentina, who died when a car
bomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos
Aires.
Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by
ancient animosities that cry out for resolution.
Not the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year
after year, for all their progress towards peace.
Not the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of
unfathomable terror with still no end in sight.
Not the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second
President to assassination.
Not the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,
Russia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where
innocent people have been victimized by terror.
None of those victims were American. But every
one was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or
mother — a human life extinguished by someone else’s
hatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never
be the same.
Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue,
of course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the
number of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,
sometimes less than the number of people killed by
lightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point
in several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the
1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater
openness and the explosion of information and weapons
technology. The new technologies of terror and their
increasing availability, along with the increasing mobility
of terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to
chemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing
each of us into the category of possible victim. This is a
threat to all humankind.
Beyond the physical damage of each attack, there is
an even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to
measure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb
10


threat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;
the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so
hard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or
child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the
rest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so
crucial to peace and prosperity.
In every corner of the world, with the active support
of United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build
better futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with
their fellow citizens and with partners and investors from
around the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in
Northern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday
Agreement. But that took confidence, confidence that
cannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure
each attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But
what are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle
East, in Asia, in South America — how many agreements
have been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many
businesses will never be created in places crying out for
investments of time and money? How many talented young
people in countries represented here have turned their backs
on public service? The question is not only how many lives
have been lost in each attack, but how many futures were
lost in their aftermath.
There is no justification for killing innocents.
Ideology, religion and politics, even deprivation and
righteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to
understand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of
course we must. Often in my own experience I have seen
that where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate
act to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing
came as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the
Middle East, whenever we get close to another step towards
peace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this
stall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,
after all, a leap of faith — a break with the past — and
thus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their
own hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases
terrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.
We must also acknowledge that there are economic
sources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses
of disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the
siren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing
social justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor
can inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents
is not a social programme.
Nevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does
not mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that
foster it. The most recent United Nations Human
Development Report suggests the gulf is widening
between the world’s haves and have-nots. We must work
harder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into
the poison of hatred.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only
revolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must
show people they have everything to gain by embracing
cooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply
an American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’s
responsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to
spread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to
build new, open economies. Developed nations have an
obligation to help developing nations stay on the path of
prosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week
ago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international
economy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens
within them.
Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault line
centres on what they see as an inevitable clash of
civilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate
in this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an
inevitable clash between Western civilization and values
and Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is
terribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any
religion to justify whatever political objectives they
have — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the
world believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,
grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding
of Islam.
A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim, from
Africa to the Middle East to Asia and to the United
States, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.
There are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the
United States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The
6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there
is no inherent clash between Islam and America.
Americans respect and honour Islam.
As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and
around the world, I see again that we share the same
hopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to
provide for our children, to follow the faith of our
choosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and
to pass on brighter possibilities to our children.
Of course, we are not identical. There are important
differences that cross race and culture and religion which
demand understanding and deserve respect. But every
11


river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in
America, like the United Nations, to reconcile all
Americans to each other and to find greater unity in our
increasing diversity, we will remain on a course of
friendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will
continue to look for common values, common interests and
common endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit
expressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards for
prayers by people assembled together are twice those for
prayers said at home.”
When it comes to terrorism, there should be no
dividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and
Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and
emerging countries. The only dividing line is between those
who practise, support or tolerate terror and those who
understand that it is murder, plain and simple.
If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and
should be at the top of the world’s agenda, what, then, are
the concrete steps we can take together to protect our
common destiny? What are our common obligations? At
least, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,
no sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on
States that do; to act together to step up extradition and
prosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to
strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce
the Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger
domestic laws and control the manufacture and export of
explosives; to raise international standards for airport
security; to combat the conditions that spread violence and
despair.
We are working to do our part. Our intelligence and
law enforcement communities are tracking terrorist
networks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of
those we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our
embassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I
will ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to
repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the
worldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in
Kenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.
But no matter how much each of us does alone, our
progress will be limited without our common efforts.
We will also do our part to address the sources of
despair and alienation through the Agency for International
Development in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in
Eastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue
our strong support for the United Nations Development
Programme, the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United
Nations Children’s Fund, the World Bank and the World
Food Programme. We also recognize the critical role
these agencies play and the importance of all countries,
including the United States, in paying their fair share.
In closing, let me urge all of us to think in new
terms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or
political action by other means, or a divine calling, but as
a clash between the forces of the past and the forces of
the future, between those who tear down and those who
build up, between hope and fear, between chaos and
community.
The fight will not be easy. But every nation will be
strengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning
to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important
that we do this together.
Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the
Universal Declaration. She said, in one of her many
speeches in support of the United Nations when it was
just beginning,
“All agreements and all peace are built on
confidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot
get on with other people in the world unless you
have confidence in them.”
It is not necessary that we solve all the world’s
problems to have confidence in one another. It is not
necessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to have
confidence in one another. It is not even necessary that
we understand every single difference among us to have
confidence in one another. But it is necessary that we
affirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together
we say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a
throwback to yesterday, and together, together we can
meet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears
with confidence.









Mr. President, may I take this
opportunity, as President of the Republic of South Africa
and as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement, to
extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election
to the high post of President of the General Assembly.
You will be presiding over this august Assembly of
the nations of the world at a time when its deliberations and
decisions will be of the greatest consequence to the
continuous striving of humanity at last to achieve global
peace and prosperity.
The Non-Aligned Movement, as well as my own
country, which is a proud member of that Movement,
invests great trust in this Organization to discharge its
responsibilities to all nations, especially at this critical
period of its existence.
Quite appropriately, this fifty-third session of the
General Assembly will be remembered through the ages as
the moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of the
Nazi and fascist crime against humanity, this Declaration
held high the hope that all our societies would, in future, be
built on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out in
each of its clauses.
For those who had to fight for their emancipation,
those such as ourselves, who, with United Nations help, had
to free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights served as the
vindication of the justice of our cause.
At the same time, it constituted a challenge to us
that our freedom, once achieved, should be dedicated to
the implementation of the perspectives contained in the
Declaration.
Today we celebrate the fact that this historic
document has survived a turbulent five decades, which
have seen some of the most extraordinary developments
in the evolution of human society.
These include the collapse of the colonial system,
the passing of a bipolar world, breathtaking advances in
science and technology and the achievement of the
complex process of globalization.
And yet, at the end of it all, the human beings who
are the subject of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights continue to be afflicted by wars and violent
conflicts.
They have, as yet, not attained their freedom from
fear of death that would be brought about by the use of
weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional
arms.
Many are still unable to exercise the fundamental
and inalienable democratic rights that would enable them
to participate in the determination of the destiny of their
countries, nations, families and children and to protect
themselves from tyranny and dictatorship.
The very right to be human is denied every day to
hundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty and
the unavailability of basic necessities, such as food, jobs,
water and shelter, education, health care and a healthy
environment.
The failure to achieve the vision contained in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramatic
expression in the contrast between wealth and poverty
which characterizes the divide between the countries of
the North and the countries of the South and within
individual countries in all hemispheres.
It is made especially poignant and challenging by the
fact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty, the
perpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-State
and intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of the
democratic right of many across the world, all result from
acts of commission and omission, particularly by those
who occupy positions of leadership in politics, in the
economy, and in other spheres of human activity.
13


What I am trying to say is that all these social ills,
which constitute an offence against the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, are not a preordained result
of the forces of nature or the product of a curse of the
deities.
They are the consequence of decisions which men and
women take or refuse to take, men and women all of whom
will not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for the
vision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
This Declaration was proclaimed as universal precisely
because the founders of this Organization and the nations
of the world that joined hands to fight the scourge of
fascism, including many that still had to achieve their own
emancipation, understood clearly that our human world was
an interdependent whole. Necessarily, the values of
happiness, justice, human dignity, peace and prosperity
have a universal application, because each people and every
individual is entitled to them. Similarly, no people can truly
say it is blessed with happiness, peace and prosperity where
others, as human as themselves, continue to be afflicted
with misery, conflict, terrorism and deprivation.
Thus can we say that the challenge posed by the next
50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
by the next century whose character it must help to fashion,
consists in whether humanity, and especially those who will
occupy positions of leadership, will have the courage to
ensure that at last we build a human world consistent with
the provisions of that historic Declaration and other human
rights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.
Immediately, a whole range of areas of conflict
confronts us, in Africa, Europe and Asia. All of us are
familiar with these, which range from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Angola and Sudan on my own
continent, to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan,
Tajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.
Clearly, this Organization, and especially the Security
Council, acting together with people of goodwill in the
countries and areas concerned, has a responsibility to act
decisively to contribute to the termination of these
destructive conflicts. Continuously, we have to fight to
defeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification of
arms, the adulation of force, born of the illusion that justice
can be guaranteed by the capacity to kill, or that disputes
are necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.
As Africans, we are grateful to the Secretary-General
for the contribution he has made to help us find the way
towards ending violent strife on our continent. We have
taken heed of his report, which will reinforce our efforts
to banish war from our shores. I have not yet read the
report from page to page, but I will try to do so.
The very first resolution of the General Assembly,
adopted in January 1946, sought to address the challenge
of
“the elimination from national armaments of atomic
weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable
to mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I), para. 5 (c))
We must face the fact that after countless initiatives
and resolutions, we still do not have concrete and
generally accepted proposals supported by a clear
commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy,
final and total elimination of nuclear weapons and
nuclear-weapon capabilities.
We take this opportunity to salute our sister
Republic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urge
all others that have not yet done so to follow this
excellent example.
In an honest attempt to contribute to the definition
of the systematic and progressive steps required to
eliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilation
which they pose, South Africa, together with Brazil,
Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and
Sweden, will be submitting a draft resolution to the First
Committee for consideration by the Assembly. It is
appropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-free
world: the need for a new agenda”.
I call with all humility on all Members of the United
Nations seriously to consider this important draft
resolution and to give it their support. We must ask the
question, which might sound naive to those who have
elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal
to eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass
destruction — why do they need them, anyway?
In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to
explain in a satisfactory manner what, in the end, is the
consequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to the
use of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy of
some States over others.
14


Urgent steps are also required to arrive at a just and
permanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of the
realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of
Palestine and respect for the independence and security of
all the States of this important region. We also look
forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues of
Western Sahara and East Timor, convinced that it is
possible to take these matters off the world agenda on the
basis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoples
concerned.
Similarly, we would like to salute the bold steps taken
by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this
supremely important country of Africa, to enable it to
return to democratic rule and a system of governance
directed at serving the interests of all its people.
Together we are also faced with the scourges of drug
abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics, organized
transnational crime and international terrorism. We strongly
support the measures adopted or being discussed by the
United Nations to deal with these challenges and commit
our country and Government to cooperate fully in all
regional and international initiatives to ensure that the
peoples of the world, including our own, are spared the
destructive impact of these crimes.
The world is gripped by an economic crisis, which, as
President Clinton said in this city only a week ago, has
plunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted and
disoriented the lives of ordinary people, and brought deep
personal disappointment to tens of millions of people
around the world.
President Clinton also said:
“Recent press reports have described an entire
generation working its way into the middle class for
over 25 years, then being plummeted into poverty
within a matter of months. The stories are
heartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live in
the lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class families
who owned their own homes, sent their children to
college, travelled abroad, now living by selling their
possessions.”
President Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” in
the world economy
“have brought or aggravated problems in Russia and
Asia. They threaten emerging economies from Latin
America to South Africa”,
and he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economic
theory.
He further recognized that with a quarter of the
world’s population in declining growth, the United States,
in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’s
words,
“ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growth
at home depends upon growth abroad”.
I have quoted the President of the United States at
such length both because he is correct and because he is
the leader of the most powerful country in the world.
Accordingly, we would like to believe that with the
problem facing all humanity, and especially the poor,
having thus been recognized, courage will not desert the
powerful when it comes to determining the correct course
to be taken, and following this course, addressing the
challenge that has been identified.
The tragedy President Clinton describes goes far
beyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class to
which he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is the
condition of the daily existence of even larger numbers of
ordinary working people. Paradoxically, the challenge of
poverty around the globe has been brought into sharp
focus by the destructive fast movements of currents of
wealth from one part of the world to another.
Put starkly, we have a situation in which the further
accumulation of wealth, rather than contributing to the
improvement of the quality of life of all humanity, is
generating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.
The imperative to act on this urgent, life-and-death
matter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge to
ensure that the countries of the South gain access to the
productive resources that have accumulated within the
world economy should not be avoided by seeking to
apportion as much blame as possible to the poor.
Clearly, all relevant matters will have to be
addressed, including such issues as greater inflows of
long-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;
technology transfers; human resource development; the
emancipation of women and the development of the
young; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDS
epidemic; environmental protection; and the strengthening
of financial and other institutions relevant to sustained
economic growth and development.
15


Fortunately, it is no longer in dispute that serious work
will also have to be done to restructure the multilateral
financial and economic institutions so that they address the
problems of the modern world economy and become
responsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.
Similarly, this very Organization, including its
important Security Council, must itself go through its own
process of reformation so that it serves the interests of the
peoples of the world, in keeping with the purposes for
which it was established.
The issues we have mentioned were discussed in a
comprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conference
of the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban,
South Africa, earlier this month.
I am privileged to commend the decisions of that
important meeting to the General Assembly and the United
Nations as a whole, including the Durban Declaration,
which the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain that
the decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement will
greatly assist this Organization in its work and further
enhance the contribution of the countries of the South to the
solution of the problems that face the nations of the world,
both rich and poor.
This is probably the last time I will have the honour
to stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.
Born as the First World War came to a close, and departing
from public life as the world marks half a century of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that
part of the long walk when the opportunity is granted, as it
should be to all men and women, to retire to some rest and
tranquillity in the village of my birth.
As I sit in Qunu, my village, and grow as ancient as
its hills, I will continue to entertain the hope that there has
emerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region,
on my continent and in the world, which will not allow that
any should be denied their freedom, as we were; that any
should be turned into refugees, as we were; that any should
be condemned to go hungry, as we were; that any should
be stripped of their human dignity, as we were.
I will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance will
strike deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the
changing seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into a
realizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul of
the aged, then will I, indeed, have peace and tranquillity.
Then would history and the billions throughout the world
proclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that we
toiled to give life to a workable dream.
